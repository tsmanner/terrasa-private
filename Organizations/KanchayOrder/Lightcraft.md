title: Lightcraft
---

## Obtaining and Improving:

Lightcraft is a very personal endeavor.  After an evaluation, prospective members are provided with instructions to imbue a weapon or piece of armor with radiant energy.  The actual [crafting](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/between-adventures#CraftingaMagicItem) must be done by the individual, who must demonstrate the completed item to have their membership recognized.  Only one Lightcraft weapon or piece of armor can be attuned at a time, though other Lightcraft items can be attuned additionally (i.e. Boots or a Cloak).

|   Level |     Cost | Min. Level | Materials |
|---------|----------|------------|-----------|
|    Dawn |   150 gp |          3 | Item to imbue<br/>150 gp worth of Carnelian, Citrine, Tiger Eye, Rhodochrosite, or Moss Agate.

Enchantment can be transferred to another item for 1/4 the cost, minus any unique components.

## Weapons
---
Common properties:
- May be any simple or martial weapon.
- The item appears to be just a hilt, shaft, or quiver of normal arrows or bolts.
- While holding it, you can use a bonus action to cause a blade or head of pure radiance to spring into existence, or make the blade or head disappear.
- While the blade or head of a one handed or versatile weapon exists, the weapon has the finesse property.
- Radiant damage instead of it's normal type to undead.
- When you hit an undead with it, that target takes extra radiant damage, as shown in the lightcraft weapon table
- The weapon's radiant blade or head emits bright light in an N foot radius and dim light for an additional N feet.  This light is sunlight.  While the blade persists, you can use an action or bonus action to speak the command word, expanding or reducing its radius of bright and dim light by 5 feet each, to a minimum of 5 feet.

## Armor
---
Common properties:
- It has N charges, and it regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing it, you may expend one charge to use [Eyes of the Grave](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/cleric#GraveDomain), or two or more charges to use [Channel Divinity: Turn Undead](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/cleric#ClassFeatures) with a Cleric level equal to two times the number of charges spent, or your own Cleric level, whichever is higher.

|    Name      (rarity) | Armor Class<br/>Bonus | Resistance | Charges | DC |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------|---------|----|
|    Dawn  (_uncommon_) |                    +0 |            |       1 | 11 |
| Morning      (_rare_) |                    +1 |   Necrotic |       2 | 13 |
|     Day (_very rare_) |                    +2 |   Necrotic |       3 | 15 |
|  Zenith (_legendary_) |                    +3 |   Necrotic |       4 | 17 |

### **Heavy**
Trait ideas
- When you are struck, the armor glows, storing the energy of the attack.  The energy is released on your first successful attack before the end of your next turn, dealing an additional (1/2/3/4) radiant damage per strike made against you.


### **Medium**
Trait ideas
- When you would be hit by a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one charge to cause the armor to flash brightly, imposing disadvantage on the attack, and preventing the attacker from making an attack of opportunity against you before the end of your next turn.


### **Light**
Trait ideas
- When you make a stealth check, you may expend one charge to bend the light around you, allowing you to reroll one of the dice, using either value.


### **Shield**
Trait ideas
- When a ranged weapon attack is made against a creature other than you, within 15' of you, you can use your reaction and expend one charge to fire a ray of light to intercept it.  Make a ranged spell attack against the missile, if your attack roll is the same or higher than the attacker's, the ray of light destroys it before it hits it's target.


## Cloak
Trait ideas
- Player wearing this cloak may hide when in bright light, and they gain advantage on stealth checks that rely on sight.


## Boots
Trait ideas
- Increases walking speed by 5' in dim light and 10' in bright light.
