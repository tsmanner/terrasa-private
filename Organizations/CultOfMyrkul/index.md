title: The Cult of Myrkul
---

A cult of the death god Myrkul, which has recently begun to stir.  They were a relatively small cult, isolated to the region around the Oqemarsh, that has started to rapidly grow in size and influence.

## Goals

Founded 100 years earlier, in the aftermath of the Gray War.

Izhi's recent gain in power has led to a more aggressive faction within the Cult of Myrkul gaining traction.  This faction wants to make bold moves against the K'anchay Order, striking at them more directly.  Izhi wants to seige Yalaqta because he believes it is the heart of the K'anchay Order, and his first attempts to probe at it's defenses were Sayre and Wayra.  He wants to figure out a way to destroy the city's supply caches and prevent them from replenishing them.  His plan is to use the existing criminal elements in the city to destroy the grain, whittle away at the farming population in the surrounding area, and eventually blockade the port with a pirate fleet.

The old guard in the Cult of Myrkul wants to use subversion and misdirection to erode support for the K'anchay Order and their temples and churches.  In some places in the east, they have been successful, there are a few towns there that frown upon or outlaw the worship of Lathander, making it much harder for the K'anchay Order to operate there.

Manco leads the established cult, and is staunchly opposed to Izhi's brash plans.  There is a sort of civil war happening within the cult, Izhi leading the rebellion in the west.  They haven't come to blows, except the occasional fight or squabble between members, but it's only a matter of time before Izhi threatens the security of Manco's operations and he's forced to take action.  For now, Manco views Izhi like a child throwing a tantrum; Izhi has been violent and destructive, but it's been contained to piracy and smaller coastal settlements, so it's not concerning yet.

### Izhi's Machinations

Forcible covert (i.e. not explicitly the Cult in control, just some "boss" figure) takeover of Yalaqta criminals, to attempt to organize them well enough they can weaken the city from the inside in the case of a seige.  Izhi is in league with one or more (politician|aristocrat|mogul)(s) in Yalaqta, smuggling goods for them in exchange for convenient distribution of guard patrols, "randomly" never being chosen for searches, maps of catacombs and sewers, etc.  Izhi has slowly been reinforcing their relationship, with the goal of luring them into Myrkul's service, by bolstering them with small bits of necromantic magic (temp HP, that sort of thing, via tonics, scrolls, and wonderous items).
  - A handful of small private docks in the upper class part of town are being used to ferry information and small loads of goods between Izhi's ships and the mainland.
    1. Night time perception near the water as a skiff breaks off from an approaching ship and travels east toward the Hanaska District.
    2. Night time perception near the water as a skiff launches from the Hanaska District and travels west toward the docks, or southwest away from the city toward a departing ship.
      - DC 13 from the mouth of the river or from the Hanaska beach
      - DC 18 from the docks
    3. Evidence of repeated loading/unloading of cargo at a couple of private docks in the Hanaska District
      - DC 15 perception from the waterfront that something is up
      - DC 11 investigation from one of the private docks
    4. Notice a boat at a private dock that doesn't fit in: it appears to be a dinghy designed for shuttling to and from a tall ship, not a recreational skiff like the rest.  It's in worse shape than the other boats, and has no ornamentation, including no name or other markings.
      - DC 13 perception from the Hanaska District waterfront
      - DC 16 perception from the docks
      - Leads to (3.)
      - Staking it out will result in (2.)
  - City Council member Kayara, a resident of the Hanaska District that doesn't have waterfront, but has an easement to a small private dock.  He has been taking payments in the form of gold and a supply of tonics that grant 10 temporary HP, to arrange for gaps in the town watch patrols at the docks and in the Hanaska District waterfront, and to allow the Cult access to the private dock.  He doesn't know who Izhi is, though he has his suspicions.  He is looking the other way for money, and wants to keep it that way, trying to learn as little as possible about his benefactors.
  - Jewelry Mogul Nayarak runs a very successful set of jewelry stores, and is the head of the Yalaqta market merchant's association.
    - He is straight up in league with the cult, though he does not subscribe to their beliefs or goals necessarily.  A middle aged man, he seeks power and youth, being drawn to the power of necromancy anyway, a relationship with the cult was symbiotic.
    - He has learned a couple of necromantic secrets and is able to imbue them into jewelry, saving the most powerful for himself.
    - He came across a supply of grain from "an old family friend" but had no means to sell it himself, so he used his status as chair of the market merchant's association to find some people willing to buy it to resell in the market.
    - He owns property all over the city, several pieces under a pseudonym.  One of these is the building used in the "Helmed Horror" event.
    - He lives on the waterfront in the Hanaska District, and has a small dock there.

Weaken the population of farmers and tradespeople in the region to put the city's food supplies at risk and increase the load of sick or injured.

Some sort of sabotage of the naval presence in the port to allow the pirate fleet to blockade it if they need to.  Orchestrating a war seems too far (and too CritRole), and too indirect.  Izhi would either directly cripple the ships there, or would draw them out somehow through more direct action.  Maybe a feint attack on Chimaylla through the ice floes in winter could get the navy from Yalaqta to move, and risk being iced in.


## Locations

### Tower

### Fortress

### Tomb

### Temple

Abandoned and overgrown, this large temple is architecturally similar to the ones found near settlements, but the stonework is crude and it is covered in moss and lichen.  It was built hundreds of years ago and lost to time after a disaster wiped the surrounding settlement out.  There are still signs of that place around, mostly buried piles of stone that are a little too square to be natural, and the oldest trees growing almost in rows in some places.  What was once a small village, is now the home to a necromancer of Myrkul.
