## Locations
---

### Tower

### Fortress

### Tomb

### Temple

Abandoned and overgrown, this large temple is architecturally similar to the ones found near settlements, but the stonework is crude and it is covered in moss and lichen.  It was built hundreds of years ago and lost to time after a disaster wiped the surrounding settlement out.  There are still signs of that place around, mostly buried piles of stone that are a little too square to be natural, and the oldest trees growing almost in rows in some places.  What was once a small village, is now the home to a necromancer of Myrkul.
