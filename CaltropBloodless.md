# Caltrop Bloodless (Ryan)

Former crew for captain Izhi, a regionally infamous pirate.  Cheated Caltrop out of his share of "the profits" and he wants his due.



Plot ideas:
Izhi is a lich or pursuing the ability to become one.
Izhi came across a sentient item of some kind that is evil and has made him more bloodthirsty as it seeks to sate it's thirst, and/or release it's master from imprisonment/the lower planes/whatever and unleash it on the world.

Over time he became more and more violent, slaughtering entire crews for the smallest of slights.  More often than not, leaving no survivors after comandeering a ship.

Why did Caltrop abandon the crew?
  - He grew a conscience?
  - He refused to take part in an unjustified slaughter?
  - He found out that the captain was under the influence of dark magic and banished or is thought dead?
