title: Hammer and Nails
subtitle: Gromag beats up a beggar, Caltrop gets his hammer and nails
---

~4pm: head back to slums to try to "drum up an army of thugs."  30-something hooker they door-knock tells them of 3 men, 2 normal sized and one burly one that seemed dumb "because the others had to keep shouting at him." The big one seemed to be injured, kinda shuffling and with a limp (he's a ghoul).

Head down to the den and scope it out.  Kurt to the roof, Ryan/Nick to a general store across the street, asking an old man about the area.  Strange noises at night from the den.  Ryan decides _not_ to steal anything from the guy.

They approach the "beggar" out front to try and social engineer some information out of him, when Gromag decides to knee him in the face.  3 more thugs come out of the building, one to the street, one in the door, and one inside with a crossbow.  They take down all four pretty quickly, Gromag taking a few hits.  Gluteus gets some good hits in on the ones in the street from the roof of the general store.  Caltrop grapples and eventually finishes off the "beggar," moving across the street and threading the needle through the front door to soften up the crossbow wielding thug inside.  Gromag finishes off the one in the door with a crack to the head with his staff, somersaulting over his falling body and dashing to the one inside, knocking him out with a jab to the face.

Hearing the commotion, someone calls from deeper inside asking what's going on, Gromag shouts back, unconvincingly, that everything is fine out front.  At the sound of more footsteps, they decide to quickly drag the bodies into an alley around the corner, barely avoiding the notice of the remaining thugs.  The thugs appear to barricade the front door, prompting Caltrop to investigate the back entrance and the building next door.  A long abandoned tavern or guild hall of some kind, that building is empty.  caltrop finds a window directly across the alley from the back door and sets up, using an old piece of discarded furniture to steady himself.

Two men exit the back door with hammers, nails, and spools of wire, each moving a short way down the alley, working for a few minutes.  On the way back in, one storms through the door, slamming it behind him, the other stopping to take a second to think about where the four missing men went.  As he stares off into the distance in thought, he realizes that he's looking directly at Caltrop, who immediately looses two bolts at him.  The man shouts then tries to get through the half-boarded up window by kicking some of the material out of the way, but it's softer than he expects and his foot sinks deep in, tripping him.  Caltrop finishes him off with a dagger and pull his body through the window.  While trying to find the hammer, nails, and wire, the door opens again, and the man emerging gets a pair of jabs with his dagger in at Caltrop, who then retreats.

The crew takes a short rest, hidden in the other alleyway to recuperate before their final assault on the thieves' den.
