Tracked the ladder to some rubble near a decrepit shanty, which is abandoned.  They leave Kilvin behind to keep an eye out, in case anyone comes for the ladder.

They go to The Rusty Nail, a tavern by the dockside.  Ask drunk dockworker about the tavern keeper, Olaya.  Approach the bar and talk to Olaya a bit, interrupted by Llaska, who speaks to Caltrop in the Thieves' Cant.  He and Michik had been small time thieves before.

Dockside: East side, more spaced out, more active, mostly loading/unloading, and and out for a day.  3 Guard posts along the waterfront, small 1 room spaces with an open window and a small desk, where guards store a ledger and maintain a static presence.  Dock master's office on the eastern end, nearest the river, a small two room office with a window on the front to interact with people through, and a side door.

Party talked to a guard at the nearest post (middle, spoke to Waqar) who directed them to the dock master for more on the goings on at the docks.  They tried to ask Chalco, the dock master(mistress?), with heavy innuendo, about smuggling or moving goods through the docks "discreetly."  She replied that there are rare random searches, but generally, if the goods you have on your manifest match the goods you move around, that's all the scrutiny you'll get.  A nearby ship was loading up mostly food stuffs, the Windwharf, for a trip north.  Among other things they were carrying grain.  Gluteus went to fetch Kilvin, while Caltrop and Gromag investigate the Windwharf.

While Gromag creates a distraction by jumping atop a cart being unloaded and playing his bagpipes, Caltrop slips below.  Snooping through the captain's quarters and the cargo hold, he suspects that the stolen grain is being laundered as part of larger sales to merchants like this.  He thinks better of setting the ship on fire, instead sneaking back up on deck.

Gromag is shouted at and capitulates, hopping off the cart, attempting to do a cartwheel down the gangplank to set back up on the dock to play.  He loses his balance on the way and slips, falling into the water.  Shortly after swimming ashore and walking back out the dock, Caltrop returns and they meet Kilvin and Gluteus at the base of the dock, near the dock master's office.  After checking in with her, they manage to track down a suspicious cart they had seen loading the boat with some stolen grain, and follow it.  The man pulling it marks them, beginning to flee, and is almost immediately caught by Gluteus, using his rope to trip the man.  Caltrop follows with a painful, but not fatal wound, at which point he surrenders and tells the party about the thieves' den, the side entrance, and that evening, around dinner, is probably the best time to enter.
