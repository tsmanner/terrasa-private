subtitle: Brother Gromag has a death wish.

After resting for the night in a spare room at the chapel, the party goes up stairs to get ready for the archery contest.

They are lead into the lower level, to the chaplain's office at the end of the hall where they are immediately be ushered to a door just to the left, placed such that it should lead into the bedchamber through that wall.  Instead, through the open door, they see what looks like a storage room that opens into a pavilion in the middle of a meadow.  Walking through, they experience a moment of nothingness, no sound or light or sensation, before suddenly being on the other side of the doorway.  On the other side it is a calm, sunny day in a field of green grass and wildflowers.  In the distance, herds of deer and buffalo like creatures are grazing near a small forest.  In the other direction, the pavilion is backed up against the outskirts of a large city made up mostly of short wooden farm-style houses, many with large porches around them.  Some are built to be bigger than they should, and stand alongside large barn-like buildings with signs for various wares, vocations, and inns.  Two rows of five of scarecrow-like targets have been erected on the side opposite the city, with a small barrier like a saw-horse in front of them.  The targets are set at 20', 50', 100', 250', and 500', the ones closest being the largest.

> **Caltrop:** Wait, Dazoluk, isn't teleportation illegal?

> **Dazoluk:** Yes, but technically we haven't teleported, we have projected our astral selves to another plane of existence, known as the Outlands.  Our physical bodies are still in the chaplain's chambers in the material plane.

He proceeds to explain that their bodies are safe in the chapel, and that if they are harmed while traveling to the Outlands in this way, their physical bodies are unaffected.  Also that if they are killed while in this state, their astral self will return to their physical body wherever it is in the material plane.

Caltrop slaps Brother Gromag to see if they can feel pain while they're here, doing one point of damage to him and causing him pain.  Turns out, they do feel things here.

> **Dazoluk:** Gluteus and, you there, with the Javelins.  You're up first.  Contestants, you will have one minute to knock down as many targets as possible.  The contestant that knocks down more, will advance to the next round.  If you knock down the same number of them, we will set a target at 50', and you will alternate trying to hit it.  The first round where one hits and the other does not, will declare the contestant that scored the hit the winner, and they will advance to the next round.

They take their places, and banter a bit.

> **Javelin Guy:** Good luck, bird man

> **Gluteus:** Hey, what the fuck, that's racist man.

> **Javelin Guy:** Well, if you think you are not my lesser, then prove it!

Gluteus wins handily, 4 to 1.

Caltrop and another person with a crossbow take their positions and begin.  Many misses later, Caltrop wins in sudden death overtime.

Brother Gromag borrows a crossbow from Caltrop, but his unfamiliarity with the weapon, and some lucky shots by his opponent mean he is down 3 to 1 five rounds in.  He attempts to get in the way by running down range, and flusters his opponent enough that he misses a two more shots.  Taking up his position again, he realizes that he's beat and leaves early in a huff.

To test out the whole pain and death thing, Caltrop and Gromag sneak off behind the storage room, where Caltrop kills Gromag.  After an excruciatingly painful few seconds, Gromag loses all senses for a moment, before coming to in the chaplain's chambers standing in a group of unconscious people.  He acrobatically teabags Caltrop, then demands to be let back in to the Outlands by one of the people guarding the chamber.

In the meantime, Gluteus faces off against another man with a longbow.  He loses the contest due to a few lucky crits by his opponent.

Caltrop takes the stage across from the crossbow wielding contestant that beat Gromag.  In the first round, Caltrop misses, and his opponent takes down the 250' target.  In the second round, his opponent hits the 100' target which, a moment after it stops shaking from the impact of the bolt, begins to move again.  It snaps free of the support post and begins to shuffle toward the one that shot it.  The party plus Dazoluk and the other contestants fight them off.  Caltrop's opponent is feared and paralyzed, then nearly killed.  Caltrop destroys the scarecrow as it drops him to 1 hp.  Gromag, Kilvin, and Dazoluk get into a melee with 3 of them, Gromag being taken very low (4hp) before disengaging and being slightly healed by Kilvin (+4hp).  Caltrop is nearly killed (1hp), so Dazoluk rushes to the other side of the battlefield, destroying the scarecrow with his Channel Divinity: Sacred Weapon, Divine Favor, and Searing Smite.  Gluteus snipes the furthest target then does work on the ones in the melee on the left.  Dazoluk and Caltrop work their way through the scarecrows on the right, eventually destroying them all with no one falling.

In the aftermath, the chaplain and Dazoluk discuss how these attacks have become more bold and more frequent lately.  Upon returning to the chaplain's chambers, Dazoluk is about to offer them the bracers as a reward and is thanking them for their help, when Caltrop makes his suspicions known.  That there must be a mole of some kind and that Dazoluk is the most likely to be it.  There is nearly a physical confrontation, but Caltrop convinces Mayua to let them speak without Dazoluk present.  She stands by his fealty to his Oath of Devotion, and that they have a decades long relationship, working together as part of the K'anchay Order.

> **Mayua:** I have known Dazoluk for a long time, he has been working with the Order for decades.  It is extremely rare that a paladin break their oath, especially an Oath of Devotion.  I am much more concerned about the new ones among us, especially the ambitious ones like Llaska, though I think that he is harmless.  For your help today, I think it is fair to say that the three of you deserve the reward from todays contest.  These are [Bracers of Archery](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/bracers-of-archery), they will help put a little more power behind your shots with a shortbow or longbow.  I would also like to ask for your help, you have proven yourselves capable investigators and fighters, both things we find ourselves in need of.  I'm sure you heard us talking about the increase in Cult activity in this region lately, it happened quickly over the last few months.  They seem to be targeting the Yalaqta area with bold violent attacks, and we need to find out who is responsible and why they are doing it.  For your help, as associates, we can offer you a room here.

> **Caltrop:** What about monetary compensation?

> **Mayua:** We can arrange payment for what you accomplish, and I'm sure some other material rewards as well.

> **Caltrop:** We don't want to join through *him* though.

> **Mayua:** Dazoluk?  You would not be joining through or under him, you would be joining *my* chapel.  We work with him, as he is one of my most senior and trusted members.

> **Caltrop:** Well keep him away from us, we don't want to anything to do with him.

> **Mayua:** Don't worry, he will not be your companion or chaperone.  He is active in my chapel, but you will be free to operate independently, and please, try not to antagonize him too much.  Most paladins don't react well to people questioning their adherence to their oaths.
