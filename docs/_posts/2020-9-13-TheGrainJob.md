Check job board outside, take grain job.  Head in to town hall, Achiq, the town clerk, lets them know it's the western silo, nearer the slums and docks that is missing grain.

Head to silo, talk to Thani, a militia member tasked with guarding the grain, who they convince they are here to help.  He shows them how to get in and tells them what he knows.  Kilvin and Caltrop drop into the silo, finding the rat hole and are swarmed by rats.  Gromag and Gluteus investigate the exterior, finding evidence that a ladder was likely placed to climb onto the exterior stairs partway up and gain entry to the grain store.  While walking to tell Thani, Kilvin, and Caltrop, they hear a shout from inside the silo and run up to find Kilvin shaking a rat off his hand.

Successfully fight off 4 swarms of rats, which are largely ineffective against Kilvin's armor.  Gluteus is on FIRE with his bow, skewering multiple rats per shot. They clear out the silo of rats, and end the session telling Thani what they found and taking a short rest so that Kilvin and Gromag can recover their strength and energy.
