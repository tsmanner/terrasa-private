The party exits from the temple basement to find Kilvin and Dazoluk in conversation.

> **Dazoluk:** I got word that I was needed to help with a disturbance in the north, I had intended to be gone for a few days at most.

> **Kilvin:** Master, it's been nearly half a year!

> **Dazoluk:** I know, I know, I am sorry Kilvin.

> **Kilvin:** Rumors about those _cultists_ reached the village right after you disappeared, some in Dhagdarom thought you had been taken or killed by them.  Others thought you had abandoned us, but no one could explain why you would do that.  I was _sure_ they were wrong.  I was _sure_ that you would come back.  Two weeks with no word, and I realized it wasn't true, but I had to believe that you hadn't simply left us, so I went after you.

> **Dazoluk:** Kilvin, that village needs you, they will need a smith to make it through the season.  And what about your family, what did they have to say about this?

> **Kilvin:** Don't worry, they sent to Deleduhr for a smith, my uncle lived there for a while and knows some people that could help.  A Go'Val caravan came through a few days later, headed west toward Chimaylla and I figured it was my best chance at finding out what happened to you, so I went with them.  I left a note for the rest of my family, only my uncle knew I was leaving.  The caravan leader says they should be back in the north in a few months, I though it would be best to stay with them, they always need help on the road, and they're good people.

> **Dazoluk:** I'm sure you could have made the trip back from Chimaylla yourself.  That said, I am glad to see you, and impressed by what you and your companions have accomplished in your short time here!

> **Dazoluk turns toward the others of the party, saying:** I am Dazoluk Forgemaker, Paladin of Lathander, and Fellow of the K'anchay Order.  And you are?

They make their introductions, Dazoluk pressing Caltrop a bit about his surname "Bloodless."

> **Dazoluk** We should head back to report what happened here today.  It would be much easier to explain if you were to join us.

The party heads back to Yalaqta with Dazoluk, and enters a small chapel in the Terrace Quarter, spanning the slope of one terrace.  They enter through a low, wide, doorway into the upper floor, with low walls and a steep, vaulted ceiling, the peak nearly 20' high.  Inside is a single large roughly 20x20 foot common room, with some tables, chairs, and a moveable dias, a small counter and store room at one end, and a staircase.  Downstairs there is a small living room space and a hallway with several small rooms to the sides and a large door at the end.  Dazoluk leads them to the door at the end of the hall, and into the study in the Chaplain's chambers.

> **Dazoluk:**  Chaplain, we were successful in tracking down the necromancer known as Wayra, though she had been dealt with by the time we arrived.

> **Mayua:**  That is good to hear Forgemaker.  She had been... dealt with?

> **Dazoluk - gesturing behind him at the party:**  After bringing in the Sending Stone, Llaska... proactively... enlisted the help of these four, to get to Wayra's lair before our planned assault.  They dispatched Wayra just as we arrived.

> **Mayua - thinks for a second, holding up a hand to stop Llaska as he starts to speak:**  Llaska, that was reckless of you to do without consulting with us first.  It worked out this time, thank Lathander there were no casualties.

> **Llaska, chuckling:**  Listen, these guys are the real deal, we had no trouble at all, unless you count the fact that I'm still a little stiff.

> **Mayua:**  Regardless, you went without backup and without a plan.  We can't have people doing that, Llaska.

> **Dazoluk:**  If I may, his actions, and the actions of all five of them, were bold, but effective.  They demonstrated courage and righteousness, not to mention skill, today.  While I agree we can't encourage reckless behavior, I think we should be rewarding the _good_ that was done here today by these people.  This man, Kilvin Greyjaw, was my apprentice in Dhagdarom.  He left home to search for me, and I found him here, having traveled Ciann for months helping those in need.

> **Mayua:**  I see your point, we'll discuss it more later.  For now, I thank you for your help, and I hope that we can continue to work together.  Take this as a token of thanks, and a promise of future cooperation.

> **Mayua:** Dazoluk, see to them as our guests for the time being, and grant them what you think is fair for their defeat of Wayra.

> **Dazoluk:** Of course, Chaplain.  Thank you.


The party heads back upstairs, where Dazoluk gives them a pair of Lightcraft Boots and 200gp each.  He answers some of their questions about the K'anchay Order, and explains some of the amenities available at the Chapel.

> **Dazoluk - back in the common area:** This is a K'anchay Chapel, one of our smaller establishments in this part of the world.  We have enough space to do some limited training, crafting, and research here.  As thanks for defeating Wayra, I'd like to offer you our services and access to our training space, where you can spar to hone your skills or blow off some steam.<br/>
> As for a tangible reward, I don't have too much I can offer at the moment, other than some coin and this pair of [Lightcraft Boots](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/2626745-lightcraft-boots).  They'll make you a little lighter on your feet, when you're in dim or bright light.<br/>
> If you'd like to know more about the Order, I'd be happy to answer what questions I can.

Brother Gromag tries the boots on, trying to jump on Dazoluk, assuming the boots helped with jump height.  Instead, he was shrugged off and told to sprint the length of the chamber, which he did a little faster than normal.  Dazoluk then takes him outside and has him sprint the same distance in the sunlight, which he does much faster than normal.

The party asked about local weapon and armor merchants, and headed out, purchasing studded leathers for Caltrop and Gluteus.  Brother Gromag tried on the ring they found, revealing it to be a [Ring of Protection](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/ring-of-protection).
