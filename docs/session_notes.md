### Session 1
---

Caravan arrives: Maran calls all the the caravan guards over, including the party.

> Maran: Now that we've reached Yalaqta, we're going to head to the market to trade. We'll be here, eh..., three to four days, depending on how things go. In the meantime, if you'd like to keep busy, there are a couple places around that usually have jobs posted.

> Maran (pointing left): If you head over to town hall they usually have some postings about issues affecting the locals, weird happenings by the farms or rats in the sewer, that sort of thing.

> Maran (pointing behind): There's a militia barracks back the way we came, near where we entered town.  They're always looking for able bodies to help with bandits and criminals.

> Maran (pointing ahead): Oh, and I almost forgot, the market! Sometimes wares go missing and the merchants there need someone to look into it, or, if it suits your fancy, there are usually caravans packing up to head to another town, and every caravan needs an escort.

> Maran (handing each of you 1gp): Here's your pay for this leg of the journey, and I hope to be hearing from you in a couple days. Good luck out there!

Maran walks back over to the wagons shouting "Ok everybody, let's head down to the market and get set up!"


> Shifty Guy (pointing right): We're going to head down this way, and get a _real_ drink. I got a, uh, cousin down there that's always got some odd jobs that need doin'.

Shifty Guy and a Hunter walk off to the right toward the docks


Two others in mail with swords and shields head back toward the militia barracks.


Two other members of the roughly ten person caravan escort. The first is a tall slender man wearing a full length robe and and carrying a pouch around his neck, a small pack, and an ornate jeweled dagger on his hip. The second is wearing a chain mail vest, plate greaves, and gauntlets, with a spear over one shoulder and a quiver with several javelins over the other and a large pack on his back.

Caltrop tries attempts to pick pocket the robed man, but ends up roughly bumping into him. Caltrop manages to play it off as though he stumbled, raising the suspicious of both men, but not inciting anything worse.

Once The party reaches town hall, they look over the job board, deciding between a rat infestation and mysterious disappearances in the woods. They choose to investigate the disappearances, hearing that a couple of farmers went missing and the three person militia squad that went out in search of them only had one member return. The remaining member is stable, recovering from wounds, at the militia barracks.


The party heads over to the militia barracks and learn that the surviving militiaman is named Frankie. After convincing someone that Caltrop is Frankie's friend, they head up to Frankie's room and ask him some questions. Frankie was clearly scratched and bitten by something and he still seems shocked or horrified by whatever he saw. He tells The party that he found "it" in the forest west of town, just to the north of the giant birch on the right.

Head to town hall in the morning to get payment for the zombies.  Suspicious of the clerk for hiding the ledger sheet, they ask about it.  Was 3gp originally, increased to 5 + 1 per monster after the militia patrol failed.

Check job board outside, take grain job.  Head in to town hall, Achiq, the town clerk, lets them know it's the western silo, nearer the slums and docks that is missing grain.

Head to silo, talk to Thani, a militia member tasked with guarding the grain, who they convince they are here to help.  He shows them how to get in and tells them what he knows.  Kilvin and Caltrop drop into the silo, finding the rat hole and are swarmed by rats.  Gromag and Gluteus investigate the exterior, finding evidence that a ladder was likely placed to climb onto the exterior stairs partway up and gain entry to the grain store.  While walking to tell Thani, Kilvin, and Caltrop, they hear a shout from inside the silo and run up to find Kilvin shaking a rat off his hand.

Successfully fight off 4 swarms of rats, which are largely ineffective against Kilvin's armor.  Gluteus is on FIRE with his bow, skewering multiple rats per shot. They clear out the silo of rats, and end the session telling Thani what they found and taking a short rest so that Kilvin and Gromag can recover their strength and energy.

Tracked the ladder to some rubble near a decrepit shanty, which is abandoned.  They leave Kilvin behind to keep an eye out, in case anyone comes for the ladder.

They go to The Rusty Nail, a tavern by the dockside.  Ask drunk dockworker about the tavern keeper, Olaya.  Approach the bar and talk to Olaya a bit, interrupted by Llaska, who speaks to Caltrop in the Thieves' Cant.  He and Michik had been small time thieves before.

Dockside: East side, more spaced out, more active, mostly loading/unloading, and and out for a day.  3 Guard posts along the waterfront, small 1 room spaces with an open window and a small desk, where guards store a ledger and maintain a static presence.  Dock master's office on the eastern end, nearest the river, a small two room office with a window on the front to interact with people through, and a side door.

Party talked to a guard at the nearest post (middle, spoke to Waqar) who directed them to the dock master for more on the goings on at the docks.  They tried to ask Chalco, the dock master(mistress?), with heavy innuendo, about smuggling or moving goods through the docks "discreetly."  She replied that there are rare random searches, but generally, if the goods you have on your manifest match the goods you move around, that's all the scrutiny you'll get.  A nearby ship was loading up mostly food stuffs, the Windwharf, for a trip north.  Among other things they were carrying grain.  Gluteus went to fetch Kilvin, while Caltrop and Gromag investigate the Windwharf.

While Gromag creates a distraction by jumping atop a cart being unloaded and playing his bagpipes, Caltrop slips below.  Snooping through the captain's quarters and the cargo hold, he suspects that the stolen grain is being laundered as part of larger sales to merchants like this.  He thinks better of setting the ship on fire, instead sneaking back up on deck.

Gromag is shouted at and capitulates, hopping off the cart, attempting to do a cartwheel down the gangplank to set back up on the dock to play.  He loses his balance on the way and slips, falling into the water.  Shortly after swimming ashore and walking back out the dock, Caltrop returns and they meet Kilvin and Gluteus at the base of the dock, near the dock master's office.  After checking in with her, they manage to track down a suspicious cart they had seen loading the boat with some stolen grain, and follow it.  The man pulling it marks them, beginning to flee, and is almost immediately caught by Gluteus, using his rope to trip the man.  Caltrop follows with a painful, but not fatal wound, at which point he surrenders and tells the party about the thieves' den, the side entrance, and that evening, around dinner, is probably the best time to enter.


### 15 Nov 2020

~4pm: head back to slums to try to "drum up an army of thugs."  30-something hooker they door-knock tells them of 3 men, 2 normal sized and one burly one that seemed dumb "because the others had to keep shouting at him." The big one seemed to be injured, kinda shuffling and with a limp (he's a ghoul).

Head down to the den and scope it out.  Kurt to the roof, Ryan/Nick to a general store across the street, asking an old man about the area.  Strange noises at night from the den.  Ryan decides _not_ to steal anything from the guy.

They approach the "beggar" out front to try and social engineer some information out of him, when Gromag decides to knee him in the face.  3 more thugs come out of the building, one to the street, one in the door, and one inside with a crossbow.  They take down all four pretty quickly, Gromag taking a few hits.  Gluteus gets some good hits in on the ones in the street from the roof of the general store.  Caltrop grapples and eventually finishes off the "beggar," moving across the street and threading the needle through the front door to soften up the crossbow wielding thug inside.  Gromag finishes off the one in the door with a crack to the head with his staff, somersaulting over his falling body and dashing to the one inside, knocking him out with a jab to the face.

Hearing the commotion, someone calls from deeper inside asking what's going on, Gromag shouts back, unconvincingly, that everything is fine out front.  At the sound of more footsteps, they decide to quickly drag the bodies into an alley around the corner, barely avoiding the notice of the remaining thugs.  The thugs appear to barricade the front door, prompting Caltrop to investigate the back entrance and the building next door.  A long abandoned tavern or guild hall of some kind, that building is empty.  caltrop finds a window directly across the alley from the back door and sets up, using an old piece of discarded furniture to steady himself.

Two men exit the back door with hammers, nails, and spools of wire, each moving a short way down the alley, working for a few minutes.  On the way back in, one storms through the door, slamming it behind him, the other stopping to take a second to think about where the four missing men went.  As he stares off into the distance in thought, he realizes that he's looking directly at Caltrop, who immediately looses two bolts at him.  The man shouts then tries to get through the half-boarded up window by kicking some of the material out of the way, but it's softer than he expects and his foot sinks deep in, tripping him.  Caltrop finishes him off with a dagger and pull his body through the window.  While trying to find the hammer, nails, and wire, the door opens again, and the man emerging gets a pair of jabs with his dagger in at Caltrop, who then retreats.

The crew takes a short rest, hidden in the other alleyway to recuperate before their final assault on the thieves' den.
