### Session 1
---

Caravan arrives: Maran calls all the the caravan guards over, including the party.

> Maran: Now that we've reached Yalaqta, we're going to head to the market to trade. We'll be here, eh..., three to four days, depending on how things go. In the meantime, if you'd like to keep busy, there are a couple places around that usually have jobs posted.

> Maran (pointing left): If you head over to town hall they usually have some postings about issues affecting the locals, weird happenings by the farms or rats in the sewer, that sort of thing.

> Maran (pointing behind): There's a militia barracks back the way we came, near where we entered town.  They're always looking for able bodies to help with bandits and criminals.

> Maran (pointing ahead): Oh, and I almost forgot, the market! Sometimes wares go missing and the merchants there need someone to look into it, or, if it suits your fancy, there are usually caravans packing up to head to another town, and every caravan needs an escort.

> Maran (handing each of you 1gp): Here's your pay for this leg of the journey, and I hope to be hearing from you in a couple days. Good luck out there!

Maran walks back over to the wagons shouting "Ok everybody, let's head down to the market and get set up!"


> Shifty Guy (pointing right): We're going to head down this way, and get a _real_ drink. I got a, uh, cousin down there that's always got some odd jobs that need doin'.

Shifty Guy and a Hunter walk off to the right toward the docks


Two others in mail with swords and shields head back toward the militia barracks.


Two other members of the roughly ten person caravan escort. The first is a tall slender man wearing a full length robe and and carrying a pouch around his neck, a small pack, and an ornate jeweled dagger on his hip. The second is wearing a chain mail vest, plate greaves, and gauntlets, with a spear over one shoulder and a quiver with several javelins over the other and a large pack on his back.

Caltrop tries attempts to pick pocket the robed man, but ends up roughly bumping into him. Caltrop manages to play it off as though he stumbled, raising the suspicious of both men, but not inciting anything worse.

Once The party reaches town hall, they look over the job board, deciding between a rat infestation and mysterious disappearances in the woods. They choose to investigate the disappearances, hearing that a couple of farmers went missing and the three person militia squad that went out in search of them only had one member return. The remaining member is stable, recovering from wounds, at the militia barracks.


The party heads over to the militia barracks and learn that the surviving militiaman is named Frankie. After convincing someone that Caltrop is Frankie's friend, they head up to Frankie's room and ask him some questions. Frankie was clearly scratched and bitten by something and he still seems shocked or horrified by whatever he saw. He tells The party that he found "it" in the forest west of town, just to the north of the giant birch on the right.


### Session 2
---

The party heads to the market, leaving Kilvin behind to keep an eye out

Approach a teen playing in the market and ask about Frankie.
"Who's that?"
Party starts to babble about stuff
"Hold on one sec kid"
"Uh, ok"
Kid returns to kicking around a ball and running around with his friends
Ask about the birch tree, kid saw some on the way to town.
Ask about local kids, he doesn't really know much, except they come down sometimes with their parents

Go to more permanent looking booth occupied by a local farmer

Maximus flies back to get Kilvin and they meet up with the others by the western road out of town

Fight the zombies

Return to town with their heads as proof.  While

Ryan robs some people of their iron silverware

Spend the night with the caravan

Head to town hall in the morning to get payment for the zombies.  Suspicious of the clerk for hiding the ledger sheet, they ask about it.  Was 3gp originally, increased to 5 + 1 per monster after the militia patrol failed.

### 13 Sept 2020
---

Check job board outside, take grain job.  Head in to town hall, Achiq, the town clerk, lets them know it's the western silo, nearer the slums and docks that is missing grain.

Head to silo, talk to Thani, a militia member tasked with guarding the grain, who they convince they are here to help.  He shows them how to get in and tells them what he knows.  Kilvin and Caltrop drop into the silo, finding the rat hole and are swarmed by rats.  Gromag and Gluteus investigate the exterior, finding evidence that a ladder was likely placed to climb onto the exterior stairs partway up and gain entry to the grain store.  While walking to tell Thani, Kilvin, and Caltrop, they hear a shout from inside the silo and run up to find Kilvin shaking a rat off his hand.

Successfully fight off 4 swarms of rats, which are largely ineffective against Kilvin's armor.  Gluteus is on FIRE with his bow, skewering multiple rats per shot. They clear out the silo of rats, and end the session telling Thani what they found and taking a short rest so that Kilvin and Gromag can recover their strength and energy.


### 8 Nov 2020
---

Tracked the ladder to some rubble near a decrepit shanty, which is abandoned.  They leave Kilvin behind to keep an eye out, in case anyone comes for the ladder.

They go to The Rusty Nail, a tavern by the dockside.  Ask drunk dockworker about the tavern keeper, Olaya.  Approach the bar and talk to Olaya a bit, interrupted by Llaska, who speaks to Caltrop in the Thieves' Cant.  He and Michik had been small time thieves before.

Dockside: East side, more spaced out, more active, mostly loading/unloading, and and out for a day.  3 Guard posts along the waterfront, small 1 room spaces with an open window and a small desk, where guards store a ledger and maintain a static presence.  Dock master's office on the eastern end, nearest the river, a small two room office with a window on the front to interact with people through, and a side door.

Party talked to a guard at the nearest post (middle, spoke to Waqar) who directed them to the dock master for more on the goings on at the docks.  They tried to ask Chalco, the dock master(mistress?), with heavy innuendo, about smuggling or moving goods through the docks "discreetly."  She replied that there are rare random searches, but generally, if the goods you have on your manifest match the goods you move around, that's all the scrutiny you'll get.  A nearby ship was loading up mostly food stuffs, the Windwharf, for a trip north.  Among other things they were carrying grain.  Gluteus went to fetch Kilvin, while Caltrop and Gromag investigate the Windwharf.

While Gromag creates a distraction by jumping atop a cart being unloaded and playing his bagpipes, Caltrop slips below.  Snooping through the captain's quarters and the cargo hold, he suspects that the stolen grain is being laundered as part of larger sales to merchants like this.  He thinks better of setting the ship on fire, instead sneaking back up on deck.

Gromag is shouted at and capitulates, hopping off the cart, attempting to do a cartwheel down the gangplank to set back up on the dock to play.  He loses his balance on the way and slips, falling into the water.  Shortly after swimming ashore and walking back out the dock, Caltrop returns and they meet Kilvin and Gluteus at the base of the dock, near the dock master's office.  After checking in with her, they manage to track down a suspicious cart they had seen loading the boat with some stolen grain, and follow it.  The man pulling it marks them, beginning to flee, and is almost immediately caught by Gluteus, using his rope to trip the man.  Caltrop follows with a painful, but not fatal wound, at which point he surrenders and tells the party about the thieves' den, the side entrance, and that evening, around dinner, is probably the best time to enter.


### 15 Nov 2020
---

~4pm: head back to slums to try to "drum up an army of thugs."  30-something hooker they door-knock tells them of 3 men, 2 normal sized and one burly one that seemed dumb "because the others had to keep shouting at him." The big one seemed to be injured, kinda shuffling and with a limp (he's a ghoul).

Head down to the den and scope it out.  Kurt to the roof, Ryan/Nick to a general store across the street, asking an old man about the area.  Strange noises at night from the den.  Ryan decides _not_ to steal anything from the guy.

They approach the "beggar" out front to try and social engineer some information out of him, when Gromag decides to knee him in the face.  3 more thugs come out of the building, one to the street, one in the door, and one inside with a crossbow.  They take down all four pretty quickly, Gromag taking a few hits.  Gluteus gets some good hits in on the ones in the street from the roof of the general store.  Caltrop grapples and eventually finishes off the "beggar," moving across the street and threading the needle through the front door to soften up the crossbow wielding thug inside.  Gromag finishes off the one in the door with a crack to the head with his staff, somersaulting over his falling body and dashing to the one inside, knocking him out with a jab to the face.

Hearing the commotion, someone calls from deeper inside asking what's going on, Gromag shouts back, unconvincingly, that everything is fine out front.  At the sound of more footsteps, they decide to quickly drag the bodies into an alley around the corner, barely avoiding the notice of the remaining thugs.  The thugs appear to barricade the front door, prompting Caltrop to investigate the back entrance and the building next door.  A long abandoned tavern or guild hall of some kind, that building is empty.  caltrop finds a window directly across the alley from the back door and sets up, using an old piece of discarded furniture to steady himself.

Two men exit the back door with hammers, nails, and spools of wire, each moving a short way down the alley, working for a few minutes.  On the way back in, one storms through the door, slamming it behind him, the other stopping to take a second to think about where the four missing men went.  As he stares off into the distance in thought, he realizes that he's looking directly at Caltrop, who immediately looses two bolts at him.  The man shouts then tries to get through the half-boarded up window by kicking some of the material out of the way, but it's softer than he expects and his foot sinks deep in, tripping him.  Caltrop finishes him off with a dagger and pull his body through the window.  While trying to find the hammer, nails, and wire, the door opens again, and the man emerging gets a pair of jabs with his dagger in at Caltrop, who then retreats.

The crew takes a short rest, hidden in the other alleyway to recuperate before their final assault on the thieves' den.


### 5 Dec 2020
---

Set traps outside on either side of the door, then take positions on either side in the alleyway, with Caltrop peeking through the now barricaded window across the way.  Gluteus intentionally trips the wire, triggering a crashing sound inside, while Kilvin also accidentally trips over the other wire to get closer to the door.  Two thugs burst into the alleyway, one attacking Brother Gromag, the other Kilvin.  Both step in the traps, drawing blood and holding them in place.  A volley of arrows and bolts from Gluteus and Caltrop soften them up, as they try to get out of the traps.  Gromag takes a moment to line of a strike, slamming the butt of his staff into the back of one's head, using it to vault over behind the next, punching him at the base of his neck.  Both crumple to the ground unconscious.

The party enters the building, Kilvin taking point, followed by Gromag, Caltrop, with Gluteus taking up the rear.  They have Kilvin open the first door they find, one on their right, which opens into a mess hall.  The room is occupied by three people, each with a scimitar on their belt, sitting around a table.  One is a woman leaning back in a chair, almost _too_ relaxed, stabbing food off her plate and flicking it into her mouth with a dagger.  The other two are sitting there with a stiff posture, looking uncomfortable, each with a shortbow over their backs.  As he enters the room, he is tripped by a wire in the doorway, falling prone.  During the commotion, Caltrop ducks around the door frame, taking a shot at Sayre, taking her deep in the chest, just missing the heart.  He hears some commotion coming from the front of the building as he ducks behind the door again.  Sayre roars, and charges Kilvin, striking twice with her scimitar and once with her dagger, the second swing getting through a gap in the armor.  Gromag slips past Kilvin, taking a flanking position behind Sayre, striking her and setting up in a defensive stance.  A flurry of arrows from the two thugs in the room and Gluteus ensue, as a man bursts out from around the corner behind Caltrop.  Michik says "get out of the way, I have to get in there!" and shoves past Caltrop, dodging into the room and striking Sayre with a shortsword, who drops to the floor.  Gromag turns to strike the thug behind him, his staff seemingly passing partway through his shoulder, issuing a loud _crack_ instead of the usual _thud_.  The illusion of a human falls as the skeleton shatters into a pile of bones.  Upon seeing this, Michik drops his shortsword, draws a bladeless hilt and mutters something, causing a dagger blade made of light to spring from the hilt.  He rushes to the other thug in the room, stabbing with the dagger, causing a roughly 1' diameter portion of the skeleton to flash orange where the dagger struck.  The second skeleton also crumbles to the ground.

Caltrop asks about the dagger, and Michik tells him that the blade is "my Dawn dagger, and it is tied to my essence," then offers Caltrop the hilt for a moment as he summons and dismisses the blade.  He tells them that he is a member of a guild or organization of some kind that hunts undead, and has been trying to track down agents of a cult of Myrkul.  As they're talking he walks to Sayre's body, and rummages through her pockets, pulling out a perfectly round gray stone.  He holds it up and says "I believe this stone is connected directly to her master, and could be used to locate them.  If you help me take them out, I can set up an introduction."

The party reaches level 3


### 20 Dec 2020
---

The party agrees to meet Llaska in the morning by the northern gate to the city.  They return to town hall to get their reward of 40 gp for dealing with the grain and finding the head of the new crime ring in town.  After spending the night with the caravan they came in with, they head out to meet Llaska.  Gluteus sees him skulking near the gate and gets the drop on him, just for fun, and they head north along the road.  After traveling for a while, Llaska stops them, gesturing to the west saying there's a structure that direction in the forest where they determined the Sending Stone's counterpart is.  Gluteus flies above the forest and confirms that there's an old pyramid temple out there, and they hike over.  After dispatching two skeletons wandering outside, Gluteus flies to the roof of the temple to look around, when a woman appears in the doorway one terrace down.  She immediately paralyzes him and the encounter begins.  There's a mad dash by the members of the party to catch up to Gluteus, followed by a chaotic fight across multiple levels of the temple.  The party eventually defeats the necromancer Wayra along with several of her skeleton and zombie minions.  Brother Gromag finds a hidden lever in the bottom of the temple, which opens a passage to what appears to be Wayra's secret study, where they find some papers mentioning a fortress or outpost of some kind in the Oqemarsh, an intentionally disabled teleportation circle, and a small locked box.  Caltrop picks the lock on the box, and is blasted with fire upon opening it, but doesn't seem too bothered by it.  Inside is a single smooth silver ring.

As the fight was drawing to a close, a small group approached outside, led by a dwarf on horseback in full plate wielding a warhammer and shield.  The dwarf shouts to Gromag, who steps out from the bottom floor, "who are you, what are you doing here?"  He identifies himself as The Forgemaker, saying that they had received word that the necromancer they were hunting was located here.  Around this time, Llaska starts down the stairs from the top of the temple, followed by Kilvin.  Llaska intentionally left in the morning to do this with the party to try and get here and defeat the necromancer before other members of the organization could get there.  As they reach the bottom, Kilvin and the Forgemaker recognize each other and begin to talk.  Kilvin introduces him as Dazoluk Forgemaker.


### 26 Dec 2020
---

The party exits from the temple basement to find Kilvin and Dazoluk in conversation.

> **Dazoluk:** I got word that I was needed to help with a disturbance in the north, I had intended to be gone for a few days at most.

> **Kilvin:** Master, it's been nearly half a year!

> **Dazoluk:** I know, I know, I am sorry Kilvin.

> **Kilvin:** Rumors about those _cultists_ reached the village right after you disappeared, some in Dhagdarom thought you had been taken or killed by them.  Others thought you had abandoned us, but no one could explain why you would do that.  I was _sure_ they were wrong.  I was _sure_ that you would come back.  Two weeks with no word, and I realized it wasn't true, but I had to believe that you hadn't simply left us, so I went after you.

> **Dazoluk:** Kilvin, that village needs you, they will need a smith to make it through the season.  And what about your family, what did they have to say about this?

> **Kilvin:** Don't worry, they sent to Deleduhr for a smith, my uncle lived there for a while and knows some people that could help.  A Go'Val caravan came through a few days later, headed west toward Chimaylla and I figured it was my best chance at finding out what happened to you, so I went with them.  I left a note for the rest of my family, only my uncle knew I was leaving.  The caravan leader says they should be back in the north in a few months, I though it would be best to stay with them, they always need help on the road, and they're good people.

> **Dazoluk:** I'm sure you could have made the trip back from Chimaylla yourself.  That said, I am glad to see you, and impressed by what you and your companions have accomplished in your short time here!

> **Dazoluk turns toward the others of the party, saying:** I am Dazoluk Forgemaker, Paladin of Lathander, and Fellow of the K'anchay Order.  And you are?

They make their introductions, Dazoluk pressing Caltrop a bit about his surname "Bloodless."

> **Dazoluk** We should head back to report what happened here today.  It would be much easier to explain if you were to join us.

<div>
The party heads back to Yalaqta with Dazoluk, and enters a small chapel in the Terrace Quarter, spanning the slope of one terrace.  They enter through a low, wide, doorway into the upper floor, with low walls and a steep, vaulted ceiling, the peak nearly 20' high.  Inside is a single large roughly 20x20 foot common room, with some tables, chairs, and a moveable dias, a small counter and store room at one end, and a staircase.  Downstairs there is a small living room space and a hallway with several small rooms to the sides and a large door at the end.  Dazoluk leads them to the door at the end of the hall, and into the study in the Chaplain's chambers.
</div>

> **Dazoluk:**  Chaplain, we were successful in tracking down the necromancer known as Wayra, though she had been dealt with by the time we arrived.

> **Mayua:**  That is good to hear Forgemaker.  She had been... dealt with?

> **Dazoluk - gesturing behind him at the party:**  After bringing in the Sending Stone, Llaska... proactively... enlisted the help of these four, to get to Wayra's lair before our planned assault.  They dispatched Wayra just as we arrived.

> **Mayua - thinks for a second, holding up a hand to stop Llaska as he starts to speak:**  Llaska, that was reckless of you to do without consulting with us first.  It worked out this time, thank Lathander there were no casualties.

> **Llaska, chuckling:**  Listen, these guys are the real deal, we had no trouble at all, unless you count the fact that I'm still a little stiff.

> **Mayua:**  Regardless, you went without backup and without a plan.  We can't have people doing that, Llaska.

> **Dazoluk:**  If I may, his actions, and the actions of all five of them, were bold, but effective.  They demonstrated courage and righteousness, not to mention skill, today.  While I agree we can't encourage reckless behavior, I think we should be rewarding the _good_ that was done here today by these people.  This man, Kilvin Greyjaw, was my apprentice in Dhagdarom.  He left home to search for me, and I found him here, having traveled Ciann for months helping those in need.

> **Mayua:**  I see your point, we'll discuss it more later.  For now, I thank you for your help, and I hope that we can continue to work together.  Take this as a token of thanks, and a promise of future cooperation.

> **Mayua:** Dazoluk, see to them as our guests for the time being, and grant them what you think is fair for their defeat of Wayra.

> **Dazoluk:** Of course, Chaplain.  Thank you.


The party heads back upstairs, where Dazoluk gives them a pair of Lightcraft Boots and 200gp each.  He answers some of their questions about the K'anchay Order, and explains some of the amenities available at the Chapel.

> **Dazoluk - back in the common area:** This is a K'anchay Chapel, one of our smaller establishments in this part of the world.  We have enough space to do some limited training, crafting, and research here.  As thanks for defeating Wayra, I'd like to offer you our services and access to our training space, where you can spar to hone your skills or blow off some steam.<br/>
> As for a tangible reward, I don't have too much I can offer at the moment, other than some coin and this pair of [Lightcraft Boots](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/2626745-lightcraft-boots).  They'll make you a little lighter on your feet, when you're in dim or bright light.<br/>
> If you'd like to know more about the Order, I'd be happy to answer what questions I can.

Brother Gromag tries the boots on, trying to jump on Dazoluk, assuming the boots helped with jump height.  Instead, he was shrugged off and told to sprint the length of the chamber, which he did a little faster than normal.  Dazoluk then takes him outside and has him sprint the same distance in the sunlight, which he does much faster than normal.

The party asked about local weapon and armor merchants, and headed out, purchasing studded leathers for Caltrop and Gluteus.  Brother Gromag tried on the ring they found, revealing it to be a [Ring of Protection](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/ring-of-protection).
