### Ciann
---

Occupies most of the western coast, extending east to the southern branch of the D'Sane Mountains.

#### Yalaqta
Provincial capital of the southwest part of Ciann, a fairly large coastal city, and the busiest Cianni port.

#### Chimaylla
Provincial capital of the northwest part of Ciann, a medium sized coastal city at the base of the D'Sane Mountains, surrounded on the east and south by desert and dunes.  The city itself is about half a mile from the water, leaving a large open plain between it and the port proper.  The port is made up of large segmented docks, some of which are moored around the perimeter to act as wave breaks instead of a permanent break wall.  The structures in this section of the city all have shallow wedge shaped stone walls facing northwest (Perception 20 from Chimaylla, 15 on approach, 10 once in the port), designed to shed sea ice when storms blow it up the beach from the north (History 18).

### Deleduhr
Dwarven city in the D'Sane Mountains, about 50 miles east northeast of Chimaylla.  Strong trade routes between them, with large amounts of ore, metal, and forged goods being exported, and most food and textiles being imported.

### Dhagdarom
Small dwarven village in the foothills of the D'Sane Mountains, south of Deleduhr.
