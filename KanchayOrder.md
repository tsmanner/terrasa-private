# The K'anchay (Light) Order
An organization that spans all of terrasa, working in the service of Lathander, god of birth and renewal.

There are several types of K'anchay chapter:


## Monastaries
---
Members at monastaries focus on studying ways to channel and manipulate radiant energy.  They're typically located in hard to reach areas, like the top of a mountain, or at the end of a long trek through a desert.  Settlements have cropped up near a few, as the families of people associated with the monastaries have followed them and expanded.  These settlements are mostly aligned in purpose with the K'anchay Order, supporting the monastary and the cause.  They are also the source of many of the martial personnel, as the monastary itself is inhabited mostly by Monks and Wizards.

## Temples, Chapels, and Churches

Found in many cities, though most keep their ties to the K'anchay Order a secret.  These locations, when possible, are openly places of worship to Lathander.  When that is not possible, they are places of worship to other Good dieties whos interests align with those of Lathander.  Training here focuses on a combination of martial prowess and channeling divine energy to destroy the forces of death.

## Light-Craft
---
Created new weapons to outfit their martial members with:
Common properies of all light-craft weapons:
  - May be any simple or martial weapon.
  - The item appears to be just a hilt, shaft, or quiver of normal arrows or bolts.
  - While holding it, you can use a bonus action to cause a blade or head of pure radiance to spring into existence, or make the blade or head disappear.
  - While the blade or head of a one handed or versatile weapon exists, the weapon has the finesse property.
  - Radiant damage instead of it's normal type
  - When you hit an undead with it, that target takes extra radiant damage, as shown in the light-craft weapon table
  - The weapon's luminous blade or head emits bright light in an X foot radius and dim light for an additional X feet.  This light is sunlight.  The initial light radius is the bold value.  While the blade persists, you can use an action to expand or reduce its radius of bright and dim light by 5 feet each, within the set of values listed.
