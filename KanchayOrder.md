# The K'anchay (Light) Order
An organization that spans all of terrasa, working in the service of Lathander, god of birth and renewal.

There are several types of K'anchay chapter:

## Locations

|-----------|------------------------|------------------

| Oasis     | Faunel                 | The Wilderness of the Beastlands

### Monasteries
---
Members at monasteries focus on studying ways to channel and manipulate radiant energy.  They're typically located in hard to reach areas, like the top of a mountain, or at the end of a long trek through a desert.  Settlements have cropped up near a few, as the families of people associated with the monasteries have followed them and expanded.  These settlements are mostly aligned in purpose with the K'anchay Order, supporting the monastery and the cause.  They are also the source of many of the martial personnel, as the monastery itself is inhabited mostly by Monks and Wizards.

### Temples, Chapels, and Churches
---
Found in many cities, though most keep their ties to the K'anchay Order a secret.  These locations, when possible, are openly places of worship to Lathander.  When that is not possible, they are places of worship to other Good deities who's interests align with those of Lathander, or mutual enemies of Myrkul.  Training here focuses on a combination of martial prowess and channeling divine energy to destroy the forces of death.

### Gardens and Oases
---
Tucked into quiet corners of the world, these locations are habitats tended by those that wish to protect and maintain the natural world.  Often headed by Druids, Gardens and Oases tend to focus their training on survival in the wilderness, encouraging natural growth, and channeling the energy of the natural world and it's spirits and gods.  Gardens can be anything from a tended area of forest or prairie, to a curated botanical garden at a university.  Oases are islands of life in otherwise lifeless regions, usually the result of a spring, they exist in deserts and wastelands.

## Travel Between Locations
---

Members of the K'anchay Order are able to travel between sites via portals to the gateway cities in the Outlands.  Travel is achieved through a re-skin of the Astral Projection spell which sends players to a particular location in the Outlands.  Less experienced members are chaperoned on their journeys, instructed not to stray, especially while traveling the region near Faunel.

### Monastery

Monasteries are connected to the region immediately surrounding Tradegate.  The public portions of their interiors are straightforward, though some rooms have apparently false door, which open into solid walls, or open cliff faces.  When their command word is spoken, these doors open into a mirror image of the monastery in the Outlands, near the city of Tradegate.  The two monasteries are exact mirror images of each other.

### Temples

### Chapels

### Churches

### Gardens

Trails through dense foliage, either forest, tall grass, reeds, or something similar, wind through the Garden.  When followed precisely, they end at the edge of a dense wood across a meadow from Faunel, in the middle of a garden within it, or rounding a large tree or boulder to find yourself coming out of a partially overgrown alley.  When you look over your shoulder the trail is no longer there, though occasionally you catch a glimmer of motion where there shouldn't be any, or the faint incongruous sound of the space you transitioned from.

### Oases

There is a small semicircular building next to the pool in the center of the oasis, the flat wall spanning a small portion of it, the wall disappearing beneath the surface.  A basin inside is filled with water drawn from the pool, which is still and glass-like.  The reflection in the surface of it shows the same room, with some subtle differences, a decoration is oriented differently, or is a different shade.  Perhaps most notably, your companions in the room aren't there, though you do catch some other people walking by.  When you touch the surface, it feels cool, but when you remove your hand, it is dry. Submerging in the pool is disorienting, as gravity seems to reverse itself, and when you break the surface, you are in the reflected room.

## Light-Craft

### Obtaining and Improving:

Light-Craft is a very personal endeavor.  After an evaluation, prospective members are provided with instructions to imbue a weapon or piece of armor with radiant energy.  The actual [crafting](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/between-adventures#CraftingaMagicItem) must be done by the individual, who must demonstrate the completed item to have their membership recognized.

|   Level | Cost | Min. Level | Materials |
|---------|------|------------|-----------|
|    Dawn |   50 |          3 | Item to imbue<br/>50gp worth of Carnelian, Citrine, Tiger Eye, Rhodochrosite, or Moss Agate.
| Morning |  500 |          6 | Dawn Item<br/>500gp worth of Amber, Red Tourmaline, or Topaz.
|     Sun | 1500 |         10 | Morning Item<br/>1500gp worth of Fire Opal, Star Ruby, or Yellow Sapphire.
|  Zenith | 5000 |         15 | Sun Item<br/>5000gp worth of Jacinthe or Diamonds.

Enchantment can be transferred to another item for 1/2 the cost, minus any unique components.

### Weapons
---
Common properties:
- May be any simple or martial weapon.
- The item appears to be just a hilt, shaft, or quiver of normal arrows or bolts.
- While holding it, you can use a bonus action to cause a blade or head of pure radiance to spring into existence, or make the blade or head disappear.
- While the blade or head of a one handed or versatile weapon exists, the weapon has the finesse property.
- Radiant damage instead of it's normal type to undead.
- When you hit an undead with it, that target takes extra radiant damage, as shown in the light-craft weapon table
- The weapon's radiant blade or head emits bright light in an N foot radius and dim light for an additional N feet.  This light is sunlight.  While the blade persists, you can use an action or bonus action to speak the command word, expanding or reducing its radius of bright and dim light by 5 feet each, to a minimum of 5 feet.

Light-Craft weapons take on different appearances, depending on their light radius.

|  Radius | Appearance
|---------|------------
|  5 feet | Dim yellow at it's base, fading to orange by the middle, then translucent pink until it has faded away entirely by the end.
| 10 feet | Yellow at it's base, fading to a bright orange, with a hint of pink at the end.
| 15 feet | Bright yellow at it's base, dimming along it's length, with the edge near the end a bright orange.
| 20 feet | Bright yellow, with soft white swirls shifting up and down it's length.
| 25 feet | Bright yellow-white, with brilliant white swirls shifting up and down it's length and a few wisps of yellow and orange curling off the edges.
| 30 feet | Brilliant yellow-white, with intense wisps of white, yellow, and orange light whipping around it.



### Armor
---
Common properties:
- It has N charges, and it regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing it, you may expend one charge to use [Eyes of the Grave](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/cleric#GraveDomain), or two or more charges to use [Channel Divinity: Turn Undead](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/cleric#ClassFeatures) with a Cleric level equal to two times the number of charges spent, or your own Cleric level, whichever is higher.

|    Name      (rarity) | Armor Class<br/>Bonus | Resistance | Charges | DC |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------|---------|----|
|    Dawn  (_uncommon_) |                    +0 |            |       1 | 11 |
| Morning      (_rare_) |                    +1 |   Necrotic |       2 | 13 |
|     Sun (_very rare_) |                    +2 |   Necrotic |       3 | 15 |
|  Zenith (_legendary_) |                    +3 |   Necrotic |       4 | 17 |

#### **Heavy**
Trait ideas
- When you are struck, the armor glows, storing the energy of the attack.  The energy is released on your first successful attack before the end of your next turn, dealing an additional (1/2/3/4) radiant damage.


#### **Medium**
Trait ideas
- When you would be hit by a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one charge to cause the armor to flash brightly, imposing disadvantage on the attack, and preventing the attacker from making an attack of opportunity against you before the end of your next turn.


#### **Light**
Trait ideas
- When you make a stealth check, you may expend one charge to bend the light around you, allowing you to reroll one of the dice, using either value.


#### **Shield**
Trait ideas
- When a ranged weapon attack is made against a creature other than you, within 15' of you, you can use your reaction and expend one charge to cause a ray of light to intercept the missile, destroying it before it hits it's target.


### Cloak
Trait ideas
- Player wearing this cloak may hide when in bright light, and they gain advantage on stealth checks that rely on sight.


### Boots
Trait ideas
- Increases walking speed by 5' in dim light and 10' in bright light.
