# Planning

Ttika, Michik, and Llaska will be 1 round late to combat when it finally starts, coming in through the opposite door.  Llaska is an under-cover initiate of the K'anchay Order, equipped with a single Dawn Dagger (+0/1d4/5'), which will remain concealed until the presence of undead is detected.  Llaska will be cagey about the blade and the org, immediately searching Sayre for an item he can scry on.  He has a borrowed Ring of Spell Storing, with one charge of Scrying in it, which he will use to locate Wayra.  He will find a Sending Stone, which can be used to communicate with Wayra before the encounter and can be scryed on to locate the temple.

Llaska wants to travel to the temple the next day to confront Wayra.

"This could be what gets me to Morning."
