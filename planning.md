# Planning

Kilvin presses Dazoluk for information about why he left and what he's been doing.

Dazoluk
> I got word that I was needed to help with a disturbance in the north, I had intended to be gone for a few days at most.

Kilvin
> Master, it's been nearly half a year!

Dazoluk
> I know, I know, I am sorry Kilvin.

Kilvin
> Rumors about those _cultists_ reached the village right after you disappeared, some in Dhagdarom thought you had been taken or killed by them.  Others thought you had abandoned us, but no one could explain why you would do that.  I was _sure_ they were wrong.  I was _sure_ that you would come back.  Two weeks with no word, and I realized it wasn't true, but I had to believe that you hadn't simply left us, so I went after you.

Dazoluk
> Kilvin, that village needs you, they will need a smith to make it through the season.  And what about your family, what did they have to say about this?

Kilvin
> Don't worry, they sent to Deleduhr for a smith, my uncle lived there for a while and knows some people that could help.  A Go'Val caravan came through a few days later, headed west toward Chimaylla and I figured it was my best chance at finding out what happened to you, so I went with them.  I left a note for the rest of my family, only my uncle knew I was leaving.  The caravan leader says they should be back in the north in a few months, I though it would be best to stay with them, they always need help on the road, and they're good people.

Dazoluk
> I'm sure you could have made the trip back from Chimaylla yourself.  That said, I am glad to see you, and impressed by what you and your companions have accomplished in your short time here!

Dazoluk turns toward the others of the party, saying
> I am Dazoluk Forgemaker, Paladin of Lathander, and Fellow of the K'anchay Order.  And you are?

Introductions ensue?

Dazoluk
> We should head back to report what happened here today.  It would be much easier to explain if you were to join us.

If they are apprehensive about it:
> I'm sure we could arrange payment of some kind.

If they demand some sort of payment or reward: stern/threatening
> That will depend on how you handle yourselves at the chapel.

Dazoluk introduces them to Chaplain Mayua, the head of this chapel.

Dazoluk
> Chaplain, we were successful in tracking down the necromancer known as Wayra, though she had been dealt with by the time we arrived.

Mayua
> That is good to hear Forgemaker.  She had been... dealt with?

Dazoluk - gesturing behind him at the party
> After bringing in the Sending Stone, Llaska... proactively... enlisted the help of these four, to get to Wayra's lair before our planned assault.  They dispatched Wayra just as we arrived.

Mayua - thinks for a second, holding up a hand to stop Llaska as he starts to speak
> Llaska, that was reckless of you to do without consulting with us first.  It worked out this time, thank Lathander there were no casualties.

Llaska
> Listen, these guys are the real deal, we had no trouble at all, unless you count the fact that I'm still a little stiff.

Llaska chuckles

Mayua
> Regardless, you went without backup and without a plan.  We can't have people doing that, Llaska.

Dazoluk
> If I may, his actions, and the actions of all five of them, were bold, but effective.  They demonstrated courage and righteousness, not to mention skill, today.  While I agree we can't encourage reckless behavior, I think we should be rewarding the _good_ that was done here today by these people.  This man, Kilvin Greyjaw, was my apprentice in Dhagdarom.  He left home to search for me, and I found him here, having traveled Ciann for months helping those in need.

Mayua
> I see your point, we'll discuss it more later.  For now, I thank you for your help, and I hope that we can continue to work together.  Take this as a token of thanks, and a promise of future cooperation.

Mayua hands each member of the party a quipu and a small journal with some partially completed designs.

-- At this point, I should make some number puzzles and a few quipu with numbers in them as hints.  When a player completes their puzzle correctly, they are granted the opportunity to craft a single piece of Dawn equipment.

Mayua
> Dazoluk, see to them as our guests for the time being, and grant them what you think is fair for their defeat of Wayra.

Dazoluk
> Of course, Chaplain.  Thank you.

---

Dazoluk - back in the common area
> This is a K'anchay Chapel, one of our smaller establishments in this part of the world.  We have enough space to do some limited training, crafting, and research here.  As thanks for defeating Wayra, I'd like to offer you our services and access to our training space, where you can spar to hone your skills or blow off some steam.  People sometimes make friendly wagers on those fights as well, which is fine as long as they're not excessive.<br/>
> As for a tangible reward, I don't have too much I can offer at the moment, other than some coin and this pair of Lightcraft Boots.<br/>
> If you'd like to know more about the Order, I'd be happy to answer what questions I can.

Rewards:
- 200gp each
- Lightcraft Boots: Increases walking speed by 5' in dim light and 10' in bright light.


Quick build some people for them to spar if they want to spar other K'anchay people and not each other.

There's going to be a target shooting contest, if they'd like to test their skills.  Pit them against four initiates with combat initiative.
1. shortbow: +5, 1x1d6+2
2. longbow:  +6, 1x1d8+4
3. javelin:  +5, 2x1d6+3
4. crossbow: +6, 1x1d6+5

Each target has an AC of 15, and they get one point per target they knock down.

| Range | AC | HP | GM | CB | BG | SG | LG | JG | CB |
|-------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
|   20' | 13 | 25 |  3 |  3 |  8 |  6 |  
|   50' | 14 | 20 |  2 |  3 |  8 |  6 |  
|  150' | 15 | 15 |  2 |  3 |  - |  5 |  
|  300' | 16 | 10 |  2 |  2 |  - |  4 |  
|  500' | 17 |  5 |  1 |  - |  - |  - |  2 |  - |  - |

The contestants will be lead into the lower level, to the chaplain's office at the end of the hall.  They will enter, and immediately be ushered to a door just to the left, placed such that it should lead into the bedchamber through that wall.  Instead, through the open door, they see what looks like a storage room that opens into a pavilion in the middle of a meadow.  Walking through, it is a calm, sunny day in this field of green grass and wildflowers.  In the distance, herds of deer and buffalo like creatures are grazing near a stand of trees.  In the other direction, the pavilion is backed up against the outskirts of a large city made up mostly of short wooden houses, many with large porches around them, and larger barn-like buildings with signs for various wares, vocations, and inns.  Two sets of scarecrow-like targets have been erected on the side opposite the city, each with a rope line set in front of it.  Contestants get 10 shots, alternating between pairs.  The winner advances to the next round, and the final winner receives a pair of Bracers of Archery.  If the players lose the contest, they'll be able to try and buy the bracers from the winner for 300gp, with potential to haggle down to 250gp with high enough Charisma checks (persuasion or intimidation, depending).


## Quipu Puzzles
Series of partially complete equations.  Color of the term or digit in the equation corresponds to the string the value can be found on.  Letter used to represent the digits are 


### Combined Puzzle

Each has 3 strings, one of each of 3 colors.  They do individual puzzles which yield an answer, per color.  Once they all have it done, they are dropped into some catacombs below the chapel through a trap door, which is shut behind them.

#### Color 1
This chamber has a simple (color1) door on one wall, and the other three have a mural on them, covered in numbers.  Touching the right number on each wall will open the door.  Touching the wrong number causes a random negative effect.
Murals:
1. The interior of a tavern or mess hall.  Succeed on a DC 15 investigation or DC 18 perception check, to notice that the mugs are not simply painted, but appear to be sculpted out of the stone of the wall.
2. A dense treeline across a meadow, backed by snow-peaked mountains.  Succeed on a DC 15 investigation or DC 18 perception check, to see that perched on a branch near the center is a large bird of prey.
3. The aftermath of a battle, the ground littered with bodies and equipment.  In the foreground, set to one side, is a group of people wearing robes with a figure in shining plate armor leaning on their longsword.  The figure is looking pensively toward a group of wounded on the other side.  Succeed on a DC 15 investigation to determine that they're trying to reach wounded on the other side of a no-man's-land littered with tetrahedral spikes.  Succeed on a DC 18 perception check to notice the region littered with tetrahedral spikes.

#### Color2
Eight Queens problem, indiana jones style?  Chessboard addressing with the numbers to indicate the safe squares?

|   | a | b | c | d | e | f | g | h |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| 2 |   | x |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| 3 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| 4 | x |   |   | x |   |   |   |   |
| 5 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| 6 |   |   |   | x |   |   |   |   |
| 7 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| 8 |   |   | x |   |   |   |   |   |


#### Color3
Combat followed by a combination lock?


#### Final Chamber
Chaplain is there to offer the basis of their equipment and to guide them through the process of imbuing it with power.


## Other Puzzles

Eight Queens puzzle in person like in Indiana Jones

## Notes

Tattoo builds charges on hit:
For 3 charges (or so) you can use a reaction to deflect missiles on a melee strike.  If reduced to 0, you can spend 1 ki to cast heat metal on the weapon or something.
Release reaction could blind an enemy for X rounds when they miss with an attack (during patient defense?).
Release to deal level in damage to enemies in 5' radius per charge
