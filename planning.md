<details><summary>Notes: Izhi's Visit to Yalaqta</summary>{% capture text %}
Nayarak was visited by Izhi that day.  Izhi is *furious* about Sayre and Wayra being found out.<br>
He doesn't care that they were killed, only that they were found and that it set him back in Yalaqta.<br>
Izhi met his contacts in the city:
- Nayarak to use his business contacts to find out who thwarted them
- Kayara to find ways for the city to make it harder for the K'anchay Order to operate.
He gave Kayara a tonic, and put a bounty on expelling or shutting down any K'anchay Order members or locations.<br>
He bartered with Nayarak, helping finish some enchanting and providing gold and materials in exchange for some magical jewelry:

This upscale, but not ostentatious, jewelry shop has a sign above the door that reads *Pari's Apt Periapts*.  Inside is a single wrap-around display counter with a few fairly simple rings and necklaces on display.  In the middle near the back, a young man is idling on a tall stool behind the counter.  Behind him is another display case with a couple of pendants and brooches in it, and a single door.  He hops up as you enter:

Items in the shop:
  - Several rings and necklaces of
    - mithral (2 gp)  1d4 - 2
    - gold    (1 gp)  1d4 - 1
    - silver  (5 sp)  1d6

*Upon entering the basement, you see a medium sized jewelry workshop meets arcane study meets laboratory.

At the base of the stairs from the alley entrance are two suits of armor, and lying in the corner is a black, medium sized, two-headed dog.*

Opposed stealth/perception against the dog and armors.  If they notice the players, initiative right away, if not, they players can get a surprise round.

## If they manage to make it back to the chapel with the notes...

Taking the notes back to the Chapel:

Chaplain Mayua puts on a pair of reading glasses and begins flipping through the pages.

**Mayua:** This looks like a project journal of some kind, it's full of designs for jewel settings, drawings of gem cuts, and arcane spell notes.  I think it's mostly transmutation and abjuration, though I'm far from an expert on arcane inscription.  I also see definite threads of necromancy throughout it.

*She looks up from the pages*

**Mayua:** Where did you find this?

...

**Mayua:** We need to know more about this, I'll sent it to one of our monasteries for some more information.  It is good you brought this to me, you have done us a service, and I am grateful.

*Before they can protest, or if they do*

**Mayua:** I understand that gratitude alone isn't enough, especially since we haven't worked together for very long.  The K'anchay Order appreciates your help, and has this for you.

*She reaches into a small drawer in her desk and pulls out a pouch, handing it to them.  Inside is 1000 gp.*

## Resuming in the basement to the jewelry shop

Kask, you find yourself on a moderately busy street, the morning after another middle-of-the-night delivery was made to Pari's.  Hoping to catch a glimpse of the proprietor, you instead see your estranged brother coming down the same street with a group of four: a halfling, a human, a dwarf, and a bird-person.  They clumsily scope out the shop, then start to talk about something, the halfling getting agitated and shouting at the human about "pitching."  The dwarf sits down behind a barrel in the alley, as the rest enter the store.  A few minutes later, through the window, you see the halfling throw himself at the shopkeeper, and they disappear from view.  A passerby going into the store, coming back out shortly after.  The halfling comes out to fetch the dwarf, who enters the shop, locking the door.  It's been an hour and nothing has happened, you're starting to get nervous, but aren't sure if you should enter and risk revealing yourself.  Suddenly, the door flies open and the shopkeeper, a boy no more than 18 years old, bursts into the street and starts to move down the street.

Kiwa escapes and rouses a guard post.  The guards show up soon after.  If the party tries to escape, they get a couple of attempts before they hear the guards shouting to them from outside.  There are a total of ten outside, two with cloaks over their left shoulders with longswords at their sides, the rest with an assortment of spears and shortbows.

### Notes

They didn't tie Kiwa up, just incapacitated him.  After 1 hour (30m remaining at the start) he regains consciousness with 1 hp, and will immediately flee (DC 18 Perception to hear his footsteps) so that he can describe what happened to the local authorities.  1 hour after that, they will arrive on the scene and start looking for clues, if the party is still there, they'll have to find a way to escape, talk their way out, fight, or get arrested.

Kiwa isn't sure what happened after he was taken down, only that it was *definitely* Gromag that hit him.  He came to in the back leaned against a table leg, near the remains of an utterly destroyed rug.

If they catch the party in the building still:

**Lead:** You there!  Stop!  We've gotten word of an assault by one of you on a citizen of Yalaqta, and it would appear *he looks around the room* also the theft of several valuable items from this shop.  *Pointing to Gromag* You have been accused of the assault.

If they show the secret lab and can convince them that something bad is going on here, then they will be warned and told to return what they took from the shop above.  The <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/{{ 'Death Dog' | downcase | split: ' ' | join: '-' }}">Death Dog</a> will freak out the guards a bit and definitely points to something nefarious, so that'll help them out with the whole "something is up" narrative.  Gromag will still have to answer for the assault, which can start with a chaperoned conversation with Kiwa.

**Lead:** If you return what you took from the shop, we can let it go, considering what you found here today.  The assault, I'm afraid, I can't ignore.  Regardless of your intentions, you committed violence against an innocent man.  You can talk to him now if you want, otherwise, we will need to contact you in a few days if he wants press charges.  I'll need an item of yours as collateral, we can't have you skipping town without resolving this after all.


If they decide to check the cellar door right away, it starts an investigation by the town's guard into the party.  Add a few random events that involve them being caught or tracked down by investigators, town's guard members, and bounty hunters (yeah, they're totally on the job board now).  The investigation specifically centers on Gromag and Llaska, with some ancillary interest in Gluteus and Caltrop, but they're not certain if those two are involved.  Kilvin was not seen by Kiwa, so he is not implicated unless they're caught.  Flyers posted for Gromag and Llaska may make their way back to Mayua, who will confront the party by asking them to see her in her office.  When they arrive:



**Mayua:** *Slapping the flyer down on her desk* What is the meaning of this?  Am I to understand that you assaulted a young man at a store, then proceeded to destroy or steal nearly everything of value in it?  Explain yourselves.

**Mayua:** Let me get this straight... you thought that because a store had something delivered to it, you should assault the staff and clean the place out.  Absurd.

**Mayua:** If you are *ever* going to break into *anything*, you had better be DAMN sure you know what you're doing there.  We have no particular love for laws, only for the cause of good.  Breaking the law as a means to do good is acceptable, but it should be your last resort, not your first.  In any case, the K'anchay Order does not condone what you've done, and you'll have to answer to local authorities for it.  If you return the goods that you stole, I'm sure you can settle this without much fuss.  As far as your standing with us... well, that's between you and Lathander, I'm sure he'll be in touch.

### TODO: Penance to Lathander

Come up with the mechanism by which the party has to make amends with Lathander, convincing him that they were pursuing *good* and paying for the evil (assault and theft) they committed.

### Ryan's Reroll

Still rogue - Tiefling Mastermind

Vengeance on Izhi?  Caltrop's brother maybe, coming to find him.  He heard Caltrop was back on the mainland and is coming to look for him.  Maybe has been watching him from the shadows for the couple of days they've been here

Already active in Yalaqta, investigating or infiltrating the Jeweler's.  Was already staking out the shop when the party approached, cased it, then entered and didn't leave.  Is already one of Llaska's contacts, they view each other as informants, not realizing that /new/ is actually a mastermind.

Ryan is Spy background vs Llaska's Urban Bounty Hunter, they know each other.  Llaska thinks that Ryan is one of his informant contacts in "high society" when really he's basically a super-spy infiltrating the high society and using Llaska as an information broker.

I can use this as a way to inject some more clues/knowledge in about the Jeweler and about the goings on in Yalaqta.  Also, Caltrop's journal was meant for /new/ the entire time, he just didn't realize that.  Once /new/ spends some time with it, he'll realize that there are parts in there that could never work and must be different, eventually realizing that Caltrop couldn't have known some of the things, only /new/ would be able to put them together.  Also, change his magic item to be a rapier or so, and include some different traits.  I am thinking that it can basically have a laser pointer in it to help with the 30' range *Help* bonus action that he gets with *Mastermind*.

He has done some work with the K'anchay Order, but is not a member, because he thinks this religion stuff is nonsense.  The combination of /Rich/'s swarm, the contents of Caltrop's journal, and the subsequent meeting with Mayua and co, will convince him that there is more to it.

Can he help the party get out of the charges against them with the jeweler shop worker and the stolen goods?  Probably, I'll have to convince Ryan to tell them that he can help smooth things over if they return the contents of the shop, but they can probably keep what they found below.

---

**Mayua:** If I might ask, have you had a chance to look at your journals and quipu?  If you need some assistance, we might be able to give you a nudge in a helpful direction.

*The journals will require a couple of in-game days to study and complete*


*When they're complete*

**Mayua:** Ah, wonderful.  I'll get everything set up, come see me in the morning and we'll be able to start the final step.

**Mayua:** Good morning, and welcome to the final stage of your initiation as associates of the K'anchay Order.  This part will require that you demonstrate teamwork, cleverness, and endurance.  Please, follow me.

*She leads them through a doorway that they don't recognize, that leads further into the side of the hill, and then down.  They enter an unlit chamber, and the door closes, leaving them in complete darkness.  After a moment, braziers on the walls spring to life. (Jump to the bottom for the rest)*


## Yalaqta Random Events


### 1. People from a nearby village are fleeing to Yalaqta
A heavy storm blows in in the night,  DC 12 Wisdom (perception) check to see or hear the villagers running toward the gate.  Some people are in the distance on the road, they don't appear to be organized the way a caravan or militia would be, but it does appear to be a fairly large group.
{% include dnd/encounter.html name="Refugees Being Chased" %}

### 2. People from a nearby village have fled to Yalaqta
The party is hailed by a member of a group of refugees from a nearby village, who is begging for help.  Their village was overrun by undead and they fled to Yalaqta.  One cannot find his daughter, he last saw her after they entered the city and is worried that she was kidnapped or is lost in Yalaqta.  Another's siblings refused to leave the village, insisting that they could take it back (breadcrumb to go to the village and find them planning their assault, along with a couple other tradespeople from the village).

### 3. An accident in a necromancer's lab (Nayarak) releases an abomination
A muffled BOOM emanates from a building just ahead.  DC 15 Wisdom (perception) to catch the shutters on a building shake, dust falling from them, and a small trickle of smoke to begin rising from them.  On a failure, as the party walks past, BANG, the door is smashed off the front and a monster burst out, engaging them.  On a success, if they investigate, they can peer through (Dexterity (stealth) 14) to see a Breached Lab emerging from a basement, from which smoke is pouring.  It will start destroying some containers in the building before heading toward the door, which it will smash open, step into the street, and attack the nearest people it sees, unless the party intervenes first.
{% include dnd/encounter-head.html name="Breached Lab" %}
{% include dnd/encounter-body.html name="Breached Lab" %}
{% capture text %}
If they enter the building afterwords, they see a door to the basement that was smashed open and some smoke trickling out.  If they enter, downstairs they find a storage cellar with a few empty crates lying around and a dirt floor.  A DC 10 investigation reveals a false wall by the fact that the trickle of smoke is emitting from what appears to be solid stone.  The illusory segment of rock hides a lab with a two work benches in it, one of which was sundered through the middle, the other tipped over.  The floor is littered with broken glass and an assortment of metal tubes, wire frames, and broken alchemical tools.  Shelves ringed the perimeter, but have been mostly torn down off the walls.  Beneath them, there are various preserved organs and unidentifiable fleshy masses, in varying states of decay.  A floor to ceiling tank in the corner, about 3' in diameter, with tubes connecting to the top and bottom, is shattered.  The smoke is rising from it's base.  (After about one minute, a gout of flame will erupt from it, DEX 15 for 2d6 fire damage and the room begins to burn).
- Investigation check
  - DC 12 find a newly finished teak cleat near the entrance
    - If they don't get the hint, intelligence 10 to guess, based on the size and quality, that it's for one of the smaller private boats they've seen on the east side of the river at the private docks
  - DC 15 for a [Periapt of Health](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/periapt-of-health)
  - DC 18 to find spell notes etc
  - DC 20+ to notice that they bear many of the same markings that Wayra's did

A heavy storm comes through at night, waking the party.  Skill carousel to minimize damage to the structure, followed by some repair mini-games?


## K'anchay Order Investigations

**Mayua:** We suspect that Wayra and the cult have connections inside the city other than Sayre.  She was able to win a turf war, taking control of the underground, too quickly to have done it alone, even with the help of a necromancer.  Her takeover was brutal, efficient, and quiet; it wasn't clear it was happening until it was almost complete, and even then, it wasn't obvious that the takeover was backed by an outside power.  Llaska has been investigating them for the last few weeks, and while he's good, we could use more help.  Any information you can bring back to us, or cultists you can stop, would be quite valuable to the order.


**Llaska:** I'm hearing lots of things, but whoever these people are, they've been keeping a pretty tight lid on their identities and their goals.  They seem to have a presence in trading and shipping in the region, with the grain laundering and all that.  After what we saw with Sayre, I think there's a major push by the cult into Yalaqta.  To keep it this quiet, they must have some influential contacts in the city.  I'm thinking, probably a politician or two, or who knows, maybe all of 'em!  Hah!

If they wait a bit and then talk to him


**Llaska:** These guys are no joke, they're moving some sort of contraband through here, I'm just not sure how they're doing it yet, or what it is.  There are rumors of draughts that make you see spirits, jewels that cure disease, and something about animating runes.  Dunno what that's about, sounds bad for us though.  I keep hearing whispers about activity on the water, but I haven't been able to dredge anything concrete up at the docks yet...  Have you guys found anything?

### Combined Puzzle

Once they all have completed their individual puzzles (plans), they are dropped into some catacombs below the chapel through a trap door, which is shut behind them, disappearing.  After a moment, of darkness, some braziers on the wall spring to life.

#### Chamber 1

The chamber has a simple orange door on one wall, and the other three have a mural on them, each with the numbers 1 through 9 embedded somewhere in them.
Touching the right numbers on each wall will open the door.

Murals:
1. (791) The interior of a large mess hall full of people in simple clothes and robes, some with shaved heads.  Succeed on a DC 15 investigation or DC 18 perception check, to notice that the mugs are not simply painted, but appear to be sculpted out of the stone of the wall.
2. (362) The aftermath of a battle, the ground littered with bodies and equipment.  In the foreground, set to one side, is a group of people wearing robes with a figure in shining plate armor leaning on their longsword.  The figure is looking pensively toward a group of wounded on the other side.

#### Chamber 2

You enter a large chamber with a low ceiling, about 40' wide and 70' long.  The center is dominated by an 8 by 8 grid of 5' by 5' tiles, that alternate black and white.  Written left to right on the floor in front of you, spaced 5' apart, are the letters a through h written in green.  On the left wall, also spaced 5' apart, are the numbers 1 through 8, written in blue.  If Gluteus tries to fly across, DC 15 DEX to make it (low ceiling) or to fall on a random square, triggering an effect.  If he makes it across, the door is locked.

Chessboard addressing with the numbers to indicate the safe squares.  Blue for Y axis, Green for X axis.

Bad square effects (all DCs are for saving throws)

| Row | Effect
|-----|--------
|   1 | A barrier appears as you take a step that you collide with, like walking into a screen door you didn't notice, except it disappears when you take a step back
|   2 | DC 13 DEX or slip, fall prone and slide to next square
|   3 | DC 13 WIS or charmed for 1 round and compelled to leap back and look into the previous room for a second.  You could have *sworn* you left something in there for a second.
|   4 | DC 13 CON or 1d4 poison damage, poisoned for one move (disadvantage on next skill check)
|   5 | DC 13 INT or you're *convinced* the floor is starting to split open beneath your feet (as with <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/{{ 'Phantasmal Force' | downcase | split: ' ' | join: '-' }}">Phantasmal Force</a>)
|   6 | DC 13 STR as an unknown force impacts your side, trying to shove you 5' to the left.  If in a6, a fail is 1d6 bludgeoning damage instead.
|   7 | DC 13 CHA or 1 round <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/{{ 'Banish' | downcase | split: ' ' | join: '-' }}">Banish</a> to the Astral Plane.
|   8 | You're blinded while standing on this square, roll 1d4 to determine the direction you move on your next round. 1/2/3/4 -> N/S/E/W

#### Chamber 3


You enter the near the ceiling of a tall semi-circular room, with a narrow staircase carved into the stone to your right.  The floor is about 20' down, and slopes gently toward the center of the far wall.  There, you see a small semicircular depression in the floor, with narrow, shallow, channels radiating outward toward the walls.  Above it, on the wall, is a mural of a road and a river, heading up toward a city on a bluff overlooking a large bay.  Placed straddling each of the channels is a workbench, each with an array of different tools; blacksmith's tools, leatherworker's tools, even tinker's tools, and a jeweler's kit.  Standing near the center of the room, you see Mayua, and an older man with a shock of thin white hair.

Mayua and the quartermaster, Yori Olaya, greet the party, congratulating them on solving their puzzles and making their way through the rooms.  They explain the process of fabrication and have a variety of base equipment available that can be used to craft their items.

Voice the quartermaster with "The Bernie."
