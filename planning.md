<details><summary>Notes: Izhi's Visit to Yalaqta</summary>{% capture text %}
Nayarak was visited by Izhi that day.  Izhi is *furious* about Sayre and Wayra being found out.<br>
He doesn't care that they were killed, only that they were found and that it set him back in Yalaqta.<br>
Izhi met his contacts in the city:
- Nayarak to use his business contacts to find out who thwarted them
- Kayara to find ways for the city to make it harder for the K'anchay Order to operate.
He gave Kayara a tonic, and put a bounty on expelling or shutting down any K'anchay Order members or locations.<br>
He bartered with Nayarak, helping finish some enchanting and providing gold and materials in exchange for some magical jewelry:

## Return to Wayra's Temple Arc

You emerge from the catacombs into the lower level of the chapel to see the end of another battle.  You see Dazoluk and Llaska finishing off a pair of skeletons in the next room, and Kilvin in the room directly in front of you.  He lunges forward, stabbing at a zombie with his spear, but loses his balance and stumbles forward.  He manages to stay standing by bracing his shield against it.  The zombie slams it's arms into him and his armor begins to glow where it was struck.  He stabs again with the spear, this time sinking it into the zombie's torso, as the glow in his armor flows down to his gauntlet and winks out.  There's a muffled "boom" and a flash of light erupts from the zombie's back.  It falls at his feet.

Chaplain Mayua and Yori Olaya come in behind you.

**Kilvin:** (A bit out of breath, hails them all)

During the conversation, Llaska starts investigating the remains.  Gromag notices Llaska crouch near one of the corpses, retrieve something from a pocket, and begin inspecting it.

If they go over or ask, it's a trowel with a symbol carved stamped into the handle

**Llaska:** This looks familiar to me... Mayua, Olaya, do you recognize it?  Wait, isn't this the mark for that smith north of town?

**Mayua:** Hmm (she looks it over for a moment) It may be, I've seen this symbol in the market many times.  You don't think -- **Llaska:** I do, I think these people came from (name of farming village).

**Llaska:** I mean, *look* at them, some of these corpses can't be more than a week or two old!

**Mayua:** (Turning to the party) Can you help us start putting this back together?  Tomorrow, we can send a group up to check on (name of farming village).


### The next morning.

**Mayua:** (Turning to the party) We've got out hands full here (she gestures to the wreckage around you), would you mind checking it out?

...

**Mayua:** We can probably spare Llaska or Serana for a day or two if you'd like to take one of them along with you.

As you approach the town gate, you see in the distance a group of people on the road.  Make a perception check.  DC 12 they're not traders, nor do they seem organized like travelers would.  DC 16 They seem to be fleeing from something.
Getting closer you realize that some of the people at the back don't seem right, you thought they were injured or slower than the rest, but something is off about them.  Suddenly you see one shuffle up behind someone and slam both hands into their back.  Oh... these are zombies!

{% include dnd/encounter-head.html name="Refugees Being Chased" %}

{% include dnd/encounter-body.html name="Refugees Being Chased" %}

{% capture text %}
This is a group of refugees, mostly farmers and their families, displaced from (name of farming village) nearby by some undead.  They had escaped that danger, only to be attacked again just up there by more!
{% endcapture %}{{ text | markdownify }}

{% include dnd/encounter-foot.html name="Refugees Being Chased" %}

**Refugee Leader:** It all started a few weeks ago.  It's not common, but also not really *unusual* for someone to go missing in the forest around the village, there are dangerous things out there.  The last few months, more people disappeared than could be explained by wolves or other predators.  We even started being more careful, staying in groups and going outside only in broad daylight, unless we had no other choice.  But, people kept disappearing, and then a couple days ago a pair of zombies wandered into the village from the west.  We managed to destroy them, but more came.  Yesterday, we saw the bloated corpses of our friends shamble into the village, attacking their former families and friends.  It was horrible.  I remember seeing a slightly larger one in armor behind them, maybe that was their leader, I don't know, we just ran.  We gathered as many people as we could and fled south to Yalaqta, and thank the stars you came out when you did, I don't think we would have made it without you.

**Level 4!**

### (name of farming village)

You approach (name of farming village) and find it lifeless.  Perception or investigation rolls to see what's up before going in.  15 to correctly count the enemies present, and for each 1 below that they'll be off by 1, minimum 10.  Below a 10, the village looks empty.  The enemies are spread out, some inside and some outside.  They can stealthily approach, opposed by passive perceptions, and even stealthily try to destroy enemies they come across.  If they find the Wight, all the zombies will aggro from wherever they are.

### The Temple

{% include dnd/encounter-head.html name="Return to Wayra's Temple" %}

{% capture text %}
The familiar looking temple here somehow looks even more decayed than it did just a few days ago.  There's no activity that you can see on it or in the area, but the tracks of those zombies clearly come from here.

*Upon entering, there is a single skull lying on the ground on the bottom floor.  When they all enter the room, it's eyes suddenly flash with green flames and it rises with a cackle.*

**Wayra:** Ahahaha, I recognize you!  Welcome back, you rats, we're always looking for new friendsss

At that moment, an armored skeletal form emerges from a passage to your left, as two zombies and two skeletons also enter your field of view.
{% endcapture %}{{ text | markdownify }}

{% include dnd/encounter-body.html name="Return to Wayra's Temple" %}

{% capture text %}
You find on the floor, a discarded black onyx gem.  There is a large crack running across it, and it is in a setting with a script NN on it.  History check to determine that that is Nayarak's Nicknacks' logo.  Kask and Tobin know that he's a shady jewelry mogul in town.  Cult members have bought from his stores before, but then, who hasn't?  You didn't realize he was providing *this* sort of merchandise to any of them.
You also find the rest of Wayra's body, which was carved up as she was transformed into the fire-eyed skull.  DC 12 medicine check to see that it was done with an incredibly sharp curved blade, and must have happened about 3-4 days ago.  If they don't get the hint, INT check to realize that's about when they were at the docks and saw that suspicious ship leaving right before they found the jewelry shop that had taken a clandestine delivery.

Also, Level 5!

Returning, Serana will talk to Tobin about his "gift" of the swarm of little lights, and offer to help train him.  She'll be leaving in a day or two, to return to the forests south east to her Garden.

### Ryan's Reroll

Still rogue - Tiefling Mastermind

Vengeance on Izhi?  Caltrop's brother maybe, coming to find him.  He heard Caltrop was back on the mainland and is coming to look for him.  Maybe has been watching him from the shadows for the couple of days they've been here

Already active in Yalaqta, investigating or infiltrating the Jeweler's.  Was already staking out the shop when the party approached, cased it, then entered and didn't leave.  Is already one of Llaska's contacts, they view each other as informants, not realizing that /new/ is actually a mastermind.

Ryan is Spy background vs Llaska's Urban Bounty Hunter, they know each other.  Llaska thinks that Ryan is one of his informant contacts in "high society" when really he's basically a super-spy infiltrating the high society and using Llaska as an information broker.

I can use this as a way to inject some more clues/knowledge in about the Jeweler and about the goings on in Yalaqta.  Also, Caltrop's journal was meant for /new/ the entire time, he just didn't realize that.  Once /new/ spends some time with it, he'll realize that there are parts in there that could never work and must be different, eventually realizing that Caltrop couldn't have known some of the things, only /new/ would be able to put them together.  Also, change his magic item to be a rapier or so, and include some different traits.  I am thinking that it can basically have a laser pointer in it to help with the 30' range *Help* bonus action that he gets with *Mastermind*.

He has done some work with the K'anchay Order, but is not a member, because he thinks this religion stuff is nonsense.  The combination of /Rich/'s swarm, the contents of Caltrop's journal, and the subsequent meeting with Mayua and co, will convince him that there is more to it.

Can he help the party get out of the charges against them with the jeweler shop worker and the stolen goods?  Probably, I'll have to convince Ryan to tell them that he can help smooth things over if they return the contents of the shop, but they can probably keep what they found below.

## Yalaqta Random Events


### 1. People from a nearby village are fleeing to Yalaqta
A heavy storm blows in in the night,  DC 12 Wisdom (perception) check to see or hear the villagers running toward the gate.  Some people are in the distance on the road, they don't appear to be organized the way a caravan or militia would be, but it does appear to be a fairly large group.
{% include dnd/encounter.html name="Refugees Being Chased" %}

### 2. People from a nearby village have fled to Yalaqta
The party is hailed by a member of a group of refugees from a nearby village, who is begging for help.  Their village was overrun by undead and they fled to Yalaqta.  One cannot find his daughter, he last saw her after they entered the city and is worried that she was kidnapped or is lost in Yalaqta.  Another's siblings refused to leave the village, insisting that they could take it back (breadcrumb to go to the village and find them planning their assault, along with a couple other tradespeople from the village).

### 3. An accident in a necromancer's lab (Nayarak) releases an abomination
A muffled BOOM emanates from a building just ahead.  DC 15 Wisdom (perception) to catch the shutters on a building shake, dust falling from them, and a small trickle of smoke to begin rising from them.  On a failure, as the party walks past, BANG, the door is smashed off the front and a monster burst out, engaging them.  On a success, if they investigate, they can peer through (Dexterity (stealth) 14) to see a Breached Lab emerging from a basement, from which smoke is pouring.  It will start destroying some containers in the building before heading toward the door, which it will smash open, step into the street, and attack the nearest people it sees, unless the party intervenes first.
{% include dnd/encounter-head.html name="Breached Lab" %}
{% include dnd/encounter-body.html name="Breached Lab" %}
{% capture text %}
If they enter the building afterwords, they see a door to the basement that was smashed open and some smoke trickling out.  If they enter, downstairs they find a storage cellar with a few empty crates lying around and a dirt floor.  A DC 10 investigation reveals a false wall by the fact that the trickle of smoke is emitting from what appears to be solid stone.  The illusory segment of rock hides a lab with a two work benches in it, one of which was sundered through the middle, the other tipped over.  The floor is littered with broken glass and an assortment of metal tubes, wire frames, and broken alchemical tools.  Shelves ringed the perimeter, but have been mostly torn down off the walls.  Beneath them, there are various preserved organs and unidentifiable fleshy masses, in varying states of decay.  A floor to ceiling tank in the corner, about 3' in diameter, with tubes connecting to the top and bottom, is shattered.  The smoke is rising from it's base.  (After about one minute, a gout of flame will erupt from it, DEX 15 for 2d6 fire damage and the room begins to burn).
- Investigation check
  - DC 12 find a newly finished teak cleat near the entrance
    - If they don't get the hint, intelligence 10 to guess, based on the size and quality, that it's for one of the smaller private boats they've seen on the east side of the river at the private docks
  - DC 15 for a [Periapt of Health](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/periapt-of-health)
  - DC 18 to find spell notes etc
  - DC 20+ to notice that they bear many of the same markings that Wayra's did
