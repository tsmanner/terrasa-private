<details><summary>Notes: Izhi's Visit to Yalaqta</summary>{% capture text %}
Nayarak was visited by Izhi that day.  Izhi is *furious* about Sayre and Wayra being found out.<br>
He doesn't care that they were killed, only that they were found and that it set him back in Yalaqta.<br>
Izhi met his contacts in the city:
- Nayarak to use his business contacts to find out who thwarted them
- Kayara to find ways for the city to make it harder for the K'anchay Order to operate.
He gave Kayara a tonic, and put a bounty on expelling or shutting down any K'anchay Order members or locations.<br>
He bartered with Nayarak, helping finish some enchanting and providing gold and materials in exchange for some magical jewelry:

This work is being done at his private workshop, not one of his storefronts.  Players may come across it, but only if they find him out and get in there somehow.

### Aftermath of the invasion

Talk to Kilvin, Mayua, Yori, and Serana about the battle.  They're not sure where the undead came from, though they suspect the sewers under the city to be the likely source.  There doesn't appear to be any physical breach of the catacombs here, but a dimension door or something similar could have been used to cross from the sewers into the catacombs.

*Rest for the night: it's a long rest so get everything back.*

In the morning: Llaska is shouting at you and banging on your doors

**Llaska:** Hey!  Get up!  I think I figured it out!  Hey! Guys!

**Llaska:** I think they came in through the river or the north gate, but they were somehow disguised long enough to get into the sewers at the north end of town.  You should be able to track them from there, if you know what to look for.



### Return to Wayra's Temple

{% include dnd/encounter-head.html name="Refugees Being Chased" %}

{% capture text %}
As you approach the town gate, you see in the distance a group of people on the road.  Make a perception check.  DC 12 they're not traders, nor do they seem organized like travelers would.  DC 16 They seem to be fleeing from something.
Getting closer you realize that some of the people at the back don't seem right, you thought they were injured or slower than the rest, but something is off about them.  Suddenly you see one shuffle up behind someone and slam both hands into their back.  Oh... these are zombies!
{% endcapture %}{{ text | markdownify }}

{% include dnd/encounter-body.html name="Refugees Being Chased" %}

{% capture text %}
This is a group of refugees, mostly farmers and their families, displaced from their small village nearby by some undead.  They had escaped that danger, only to be attacked again just up there by more!  Talking to one of the refugees, they reveal that they were attacked from the west about a mile north of town.  (That's near the old temple, if they don't remember, Kilvin will lulz).
{% endcapture %}{{ text | markdownify }}

{% include dnd/encounter-foot.html name="Refugees Being Chased" %}


{% include dnd/encounter-head.html name="Return to Wayra's Temple" %}

{% capture text %}
The familiar looking temple here somehow looks even more decayed than it did just a few days ago.  There's no activity that you can see on it or in the area, but the tracks of those zombies clearly come from here.

*Upon entering Wayra's study, there is a single skull lying on the ground on the desk.  When they all enter the room, it's eyes suddenly flash with green flames and it rises with a cackle.*

**Wayra:** Ahahaha, I recognize you!  Welcome back, you rats, we're always looking for new friendsss

At that moment, the skull rolls off the desk, disappearing behind it.

(Easy investigation to find the rug is uneven and find the door that opens into a staircase).

The stairs are rough hewn from the stone, leading down a steep passage no more than 3' wide.  You can hear the sound of splashing water coming from the passage, but it's hard to tell how far away or how much water it is.  You descend through the darkness for a short time, when suddenly the walls of the passage fall away and you find yourself standing on a stone platform in the open.

If they have light, or darkvision: you see that you're about 30' up the side of a large cavern.  There are stalagmites and stalactites all around the floor and ceiling of the cavern, a few of which have connected into large, twisting, pillars.  The stone in here is wet, and you can see on the far wall a waterfall that feeds a small pond, which drains through a small tunnel to your left.  On the far side of the pond, there is what appears to be a row boat lashed to one of the pillars.  On your right is a set of narrow stairs, carved into the wall that descends to the floor of the cavern.

If they have a light, the Flameskull will cast fireball on the platform, hitting the underside of it for half damage.

{% endcapture %}{{ text | markdownify }}

{% include dnd/encounter-body.html name="Return to Wayra's Temple" %}

{% capture text %}
You find on the floor, a discarded black onyx gem.  There is a large crack running across it, and it is in a setting with a script NN on it.  History check to determine that that is Nayarak's Nicknacks' logo.  Kask and Tobin know that he's a shady jewelery mogul in town.  Cult members have bought from his stores before, but then, who hasn't?  You didn't realize he was providing *this* sort of merchandise to any of them.
You also find the rest of Wayra's body, which as carved up as she was transformed into the fire-eyed skull.  DC 12 medicine check to see that it was done with an incredibly sharp curved blade, and must have happened about 3-4 days ago.  If they don't get the hint, INT check to realize that's about when they were at the docks and saw that suspicious ship leaving right before they found the jewelry shop that had taken a clandestine delivery.

Also, Level 4!
{% endcapture %}{{ text | markdownify }}

{% include dnd/encounter-foot.html name="Return to Wayra's Temple" %}

Returning, Serana will talk to Tobin about his "gift" of the swarm of little lights, and offer to help train him.  She'll be leaving in a day or two, to return to the forests south east to her Garden.

Mayua will encourage the party to rest and then complete their initiation, using what they've learned from their recent exploits, and the journals and quipu they have.

### Ryan's Reroll

Still rogue - Tiefling Mastermind

Vengeance on Izhi?  Caltrop's brother maybe, coming to find him.  He heard Caltrop was back on the mainland and is coming to look for him.  Maybe has been watching him from the shadows for the couple of days they've been here

Already active in Yalaqta, investigating or infiltrating the Jeweler's.  Was already staking out the shop when the party approached, cased it, then entered and didn't leave.  Is already one of Llaska's contacts, they view each other as informants, not realizing that /new/ is actually a mastermind.

Ryan is Spy background vs Llaska's Urban Bounty Hunter, they know each other.  Llaska thinks that Ryan is one of his informant contacts in "high society" when really he's basically a super-spy infiltrating the high society and using Llaska as an information broker.

I can use this as a way to inject some more clues/knowledge in about the Jeweler and about the goings on in Yalaqta.  Also, Caltrop's journal was meant for /new/ the entire time, he just didn't realize that.  Once /new/ spends some time with it, he'll realize that there are parts in there that could never work and must be different, eventually realizing that Caltrop couldn't have known some of the things, only /new/ would be able to put them together.  Also, change his magic item to be a rapier or so, and include some different traits.  I am thinking that it can basically have a laser pointer in it to help with the 30' range *Help* bonus action that he gets with *Mastermind*.

He has done some work with the K'anchay Order, but is not a member, because he thinks this religion stuff is nonsense.  The combination of /Rich/'s swarm, the contents of Caltrop's journal, and the subsequent meeting with Mayua and co, will convince him that there is more to it.

Can he help the party get out of the charges against them with the jeweler shop worker and the stolen goods?  Probably, I'll have to convince Ryan to tell them that he can help smooth things over if they return the contents of the shop, but they can probably keep what they found below.

---

**Mayua:** If I might ask, have you had a chance to look at your journals and quipu?  If you need some assistance, we might be able to give you a nudge in a helpful direction.

*The journals will require a couple of in-game days to study and complete*


*When they're complete*

**Mayua:** Ah, wonderful.  I'll get everything set up, come see me in the morning and we'll be able to start the final step.

**Mayua:** Good morning, and welcome to the final stage of your initiation as associates of the K'anchay Order.  This part will require that you demonstrate teamwork, cleverness, and endurance.  Please, follow me.

*She leads them through a doorway that they don't recognize, that leads further into the side of the hill, and then down.  They enter an unlit chamber, and the door closes, leaving them in complete darkness.  After a moment, braziers on the walls spring to life. (Jump to the bottom for the rest)*


## Yalaqta Random Events


### 1. People from a nearby village are fleeing to Yalaqta
A heavy storm blows in in the night,  DC 12 Wisdom (perception) check to see or hear the villagers running toward the gate.  Some people are in the distance on the road, they don't appear to be organized the way a caravan or militia would be, but it does appear to be a fairly large group.
{% include dnd/encounter.html name="Refugees Being Chased" %}

### 2. People from a nearby village have fled to Yalaqta
The party is hailed by a member of a group of refugees from a nearby village, who is begging for help.  Their village was overrun by undead and they fled to Yalaqta.  One cannot find his daughter, he last saw her after they entered the city and is worried that she was kidnapped or is lost in Yalaqta.  Another's siblings refused to leave the village, insisting that they could take it back (breadcrumb to go to the village and find them planning their assault, along with a couple other tradespeople from the village).

### 3. An accident in a necromancer's lab (Nayarak) releases an abomination
A muffled BOOM emanates from a building just ahead.  DC 15 Wisdom (perception) to catch the shutters on a building shake, dust falling from them, and a small trickle of smoke to begin rising from them.  On a failure, as the party walks past, BANG, the door is smashed off the front and a monster burst out, engaging them.  On a success, if they investigate, they can peer through (Dexterity (stealth) 14) to see a Breached Lab emerging from a basement, from which smoke is pouring.  It will start destroying some containers in the building before heading toward the door, which it will smash open, step into the street, and attack the nearest people it sees, unless the party intervenes first.
{% include dnd/encounter-head.html name="Breached Lab" %}
{% include dnd/encounter-body.html name="Breached Lab" %}
{% capture text %}
If they enter the building afterwords, they see a door to the basement that was smashed open and some smoke trickling out.  If they enter, downstairs they find a storage cellar with a few empty crates lying around and a dirt floor.  A DC 10 investigation reveals a false wall by the fact that the trickle of smoke is emitting from what appears to be solid stone.  The illusory segment of rock hides a lab with a two work benches in it, one of which was sundered through the middle, the other tipped over.  The floor is littered with broken glass and an assortment of metal tubes, wire frames, and broken alchemical tools.  Shelves ringed the perimeter, but have been mostly torn down off the walls.  Beneath them, there are various preserved organs and unidentifiable fleshy masses, in varying states of decay.  A floor to ceiling tank in the corner, about 3' in diameter, with tubes connecting to the top and bottom, is shattered.  The smoke is rising from it's base.  (After about one minute, a gout of flame will erupt from it, DEX 15 for 2d6 fire damage and the room begins to burn).
- Investigation check
  - DC 12 find a newly finished teak cleat near the entrance
    - If they don't get the hint, intelligence 10 to guess, based on the size and quality, that it's for one of the smaller private boats they've seen on the east side of the river at the private docks
  - DC 15 for a [Periapt of Health](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/periapt-of-health)
  - DC 18 to find spell notes etc
  - DC 20+ to notice that they bear many of the same markings that Wayra's did

### 10. Heavy storm
A heavy storm comes through at night, waking the party.  Skill carousel to minimize damage to the structure, followed by some repair mini-games?


## K'anchay Order Investigations

**Mayua:** We suspect that Wayra and the cult have connections inside the city other than Sayre.  She was able to win a turf war, taking control of the underground, too quickly to have done it alone, even with the help of a necromancer.  Her takeover was brutal, efficient, and quiet; it wasn't clear it was happening until it was almost complete, and even then, it wasn't obvious that the takeover was backed by an outside power.  Llaska has been investigating them for the last few weeks, and while he's good, we could use more help.  Any information you can bring back to us, or cultists you can stop, would be quite valuable to the order.


**Llaska:** I'm hearing lots of things, but whoever these people are, they've been keeping a pretty tight lid on their identities and their goals.  They seem to have a presence in trading and shipping in the region, with the grain laundering and all that.  After what we saw with Sayre, I think there's a major push by the cult into Yalaqta.  To keep it this quiet, they must have some influential contacts in the city.  I'm thinking, probably a politician or two, or who knows, maybe all of 'em!  Hah!

If they wait a bit and then talk to him


**Llaska:** These guys are no joke, they're moving some sort of contraband through here, I'm just not sure how they're doing it yet, or what it is.  There are rumors of draughts that make you see spirits, jewels that cure disease, and something about animating runes.  Dunno what that's about, sounds bad for us though.  I keep hearing whispers about activity on the water, but I haven't been able to dredge anything concrete up at the docks yet...  Have you guys found anything?
