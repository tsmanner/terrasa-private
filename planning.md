<details><summary>Notes: Izhi's Visit to Yalaqta</summary>{% capture text %}
Nayarak was visited by Izhi that day.  Izhi is *furious* about Sayre and Wayra being found out.<br>
He doesn't care that they were killed, only that they were found and that it set him back in Yalaqta.<br>
Izhi met his contacts in the city:
- Nayarak to use his business contacts to find out who thwarted them
- Kayara to find ways for the city to make it harder for the K'anchay Order to operate.
He gave Kayara a tonic, and put a bounty on expelling or shutting down any K'anchay Order members or locations.<br>
He bartered with Nayarak, helping finish some enchanting and providing gold and materials in exchange for some magical jewelry:

This upscale, but not ostentatious, jewelry shop has a sign above the door that reads *Pari's Apt Periapts*.  Inside is a single wrap-around display counter with a few fairly simple rings and necklaces on display.  In the middle near the back, a young man is idling on a tall stool behind the counter.  Behind him is another display case with a couple of pendants and brooches in it, and a single door.  He hops up as you enter:

Items in the shop:
  - Several rings and necklaces of
    - mithral (2 gp)  1d4 - 2
    - gold    (1 gp)  1d4 - 1
    - silver  (5 sp)  1d6
    - steel   (2 sp)  1d8

*Upon entering the basement, you see a medium sized jewelry workshop meets arcane study meets laboratory.  There is a a work bench with some jeweler's tools on it, a large desk with paper scattered around it, bookshelves filled with books with arcane sigils on their covers and jars with various reagents in them.  At the base of the stairs from the alley entrance are two suits of armor, and lying in the corner is a black, medium sized, two-headed dog.*

Opposed stealth/perception against the dog and armors.  If they notice the players, initiative right away, if not, they players can get a surprise round.

DC 13 to find spell notes.  (remind them that they found similar notes in Wayra's temple).

## If they manage to make it back to the chapel with the notes...

Taking the notes back to the Chapel:

Chaplain Mayua puts on a pair of reading glasses and begins flipping through the pages.

**Mayua:** This looks like a project journal of some kind, it's full of designs for jewel settings, drawings of gem cuts, and arcane spell notes.  I think it's mostly transmutation and abjuration, though I'm far from an expert on arcane inscription.  I also see definite threads of necromancy throughout it.

*She looks up from the pages*

**Mayua:** Where did you find this?

...

**Mayua:** We need to know more about this, I'll sent it to one of our monasteries for some more information.  It is good you brought this to me, you have done us a service, and I am grateful.

*Before they can protest, or if they do*

**Mayua:** I understand that gratitude alone isn't enough, especially since we haven't worked together for very long.  The K'anchay Order appreciates your help, and has this for you.

*She reaches into a small drawer in her desk and pulls out a pouch, handing it to them.  Inside is 1000 gp.*

### Return to Wayra's Temple

{% include dnd/encounter-head.html name="Refugees Being Chased" %}

{% capture text %}
As you approach the town gate, you see in the distance a group of people on the road.  Make a perception check.  DC 12 they're not traders, nor do they seem organized like travelers would.  DC 16 They seem to be fleeing from something.
Getting closer you realize that some of the people at the back don't seem right, you thought they were injured or slower than the rest, but something is off about them.  Suddenly you see one shuffle up behind someone and slam both hands into their back.  Oh... these are zombies!
{% endcapture %}{{ text | markdownify }}

{% include dnd/encounter-body.html name="Refugees Being Chased" %}

{% capture text %}
This is a group of refugees, mostly farmers and their families, displaced from their small village nearby by some undead.  They had escaped that danger, only to be attacked again just up there by more!
{% endcapture %}{{ text | markdownify }}

{% include dnd/encounter-foot.html name="Refugees Being Chased" %}


{% include dnd/encounter-head.html name="Return to Wayra's Temple" %}

{% capture text %}
The familiar looking temple here somehow looks even more decayed than it did just a few days ago.  There's no activity that you can see on it or in the area, but the tracks of those zombies clearly come from here.

*Upon entering, there is a single skull lying on the ground on the bottom floor.  When they all enter the room, it's eyes suddenly flash with green flames and it rises with a cackle.*

**Wayra:** Ahahaha, I recognize you!  Welcome back, you rats, we're always looking for new friendsss

At that moment, an armored skeletal form emerges from a passage to your left, as two zombies and two skeletons also enter your field of view.
{% endcapture %}{{ text | markdownify }}

{% include dnd/encounter-body.html name="Return to Wayra's Temple" %}

{% capture text %}
You find on the floor, a discarded black onyx gem.  There is a large crack running across it, and it is in a setting with a script NN on it.  History check to determine that that is Nayarak's Nicknacks' logo.  Kask and Tobin know that he's a shady jewelery mogul in town.  Cult members have bought from his stores before, but then, who hasn't?  You didn't realize he was providing *this* sort of merchandise to any of them.
You also find the rest of Wayra's body, which as carved up as she was transformed into the fire-eyed skull.  DC 12 medicine check to see that it was done with an incredibly sharp curved blade, and must have happened about 3-4 days ago.  If they don't get the hint, INT check to realize that's about when they were at the docks and saw that suspicious ship leaving right before they found the jewelry shop that had taken a clandestine delivery.

Also, Level 4!
{% endcapture %}{{ text | markdownify }}

{% include dnd/encounter-foot.html name="Return to Wayra's Temple" %}

Returning, Serana will talk to Tobin about his "gift" of the swarm of little lights, and offer to help train him.  She'll be leaving in a day or two, to return to the forests south east to her Garden.

Mayua will encourage the party to rest and then complete their initiation, using what they've learned from their recent exploits, and the journals and quipu they have.

### Ryan's Reroll

Still rogue - Tiefling Mastermind

Vengeance on Izhi?  Caltrop's brother maybe, coming to find him.  He heard Caltrop was back on the mainland and is coming to look for him.  Maybe has been watching him from the shadows for the couple of days they've been here

Already active in Yalaqta, investigating or infiltrating the Jeweler's.  Was already staking out the shop when the party approached, cased it, then entered and didn't leave.  Is already one of Llaska's contacts, they view each other as informants, not realizing that /new/ is actually a mastermind.

Ryan is Spy background vs Llaska's Urban Bounty Hunter, they know each other.  Llaska thinks that Ryan is one of his informant contacts in "high society" when really he's basically a super-spy infiltrating the high society and using Llaska as an information broker.

I can use this as a way to inject some more clues/knowledge in about the Jeweler and about the goings on in Yalaqta.  Also, Caltrop's journal was meant for /new/ the entire time, he just didn't realize that.  Once /new/ spends some time with it, he'll realize that there are parts in there that could never work and must be different, eventually realizing that Caltrop couldn't have known some of the things, only /new/ would be able to put them together.  Also, change his magic item to be a rapier or so, and include some different traits.  I am thinking that it can basically have a laser pointer in it to help with the 30' range *Help* bonus action that he gets with *Mastermind*.

He has done some work with the K'anchay Order, but is not a member, because he thinks this religion stuff is nonsense.  The combination of /Rich/'s swarm, the contents of Caltrop's journal, and the subsequent meeting with Mayua and co, will convince him that there is more to it.

Can he help the party get out of the charges against them with the jeweler shop worker and the stolen goods?  Probably, I'll have to convince Ryan to tell them that he can help smooth things over if they return the contents of the shop, but they can probably keep what they found below.

---

**Mayua:** If I might ask, have you had a chance to look at your journals and quipu?  If you need some assistance, we might be able to give you a nudge in a helpful direction.

*The journals will require a couple of in-game days to study and complete*


*When they're complete*

**Mayua:** Ah, wonderful.  I'll get everything set up, come see me in the morning and we'll be able to start the final step.

**Mayua:** Good morning, and welcome to the final stage of your initiation as associates of the K'anchay Order.  This part will require that you demonstrate teamwork, cleverness, and endurance.  Please, follow me.

*She leads them through a doorway that they don't recognize, that leads further into the side of the hill, and then down.  They enter an unlit chamber, and the door closes, leaving them in complete darkness.  After a moment, braziers on the walls spring to life. (Jump to the bottom for the rest)*


## Yalaqta Random Events


### 1. People from a nearby village are fleeing to Yalaqta
A heavy storm blows in in the night,  DC 12 Wisdom (perception) check to see or hear the villagers running toward the gate.  Some people are in the distance on the road, they don't appear to be organized the way a caravan or militia would be, but it does appear to be a fairly large group.
{% include dnd/encounter.html name="Refugees Being Chased" %}

### 2. People from a nearby village have fled to Yalaqta
The party is hailed by a member of a group of refugees from a nearby village, who is begging for help.  Their village was overrun by undead and they fled to Yalaqta.  One cannot find his daughter, he last saw her after they entered the city and is worried that she was kidnapped or is lost in Yalaqta.  Another's siblings refused to leave the village, insisting that they could take it back (breadcrumb to go to the village and find them planning their assault, along with a couple other tradespeople from the village).

### 3. An accident in a necromancer's lab (Nayarak) releases an abomination
A muffled BOOM emanates from a building just ahead.  DC 15 Wisdom (perception) to catch the shutters on a building shake, dust falling from them, and a small trickle of smoke to begin rising from them.  On a failure, as the party walks past, BANG, the door is smashed off the front and a monster burst out, engaging them.  On a success, if they investigate, they can peer through (Dexterity (stealth) 14) to see a Breached Lab emerging from a basement, from which smoke is pouring.  It will start destroying some containers in the building before heading toward the door, which it will smash open, step into the street, and attack the nearest people it sees, unless the party intervenes first.
{% include dnd/encounter-head.html name="Breached Lab" %}
{% include dnd/encounter-body.html name="Breached Lab" %}
{% capture text %}
If they enter the building afterwords, they see a door to the basement that was smashed open and some smoke trickling out.  If they enter, downstairs they find a storage cellar with a few empty crates lying around and a dirt floor.  A DC 10 investigation reveals a false wall by the fact that the trickle of smoke is emitting from what appears to be solid stone.  The illusory segment of rock hides a lab with a two work benches in it, one of which was sundered through the middle, the other tipped over.  The floor is littered with broken glass and an assortment of metal tubes, wire frames, and broken alchemical tools.  Shelves ringed the perimeter, but have been mostly torn down off the walls.  Beneath them, there are various preserved organs and unidentifiable fleshy masses, in varying states of decay.  A floor to ceiling tank in the corner, about 3' in diameter, with tubes connecting to the top and bottom, is shattered.  The smoke is rising from it's base.  (After about one minute, a gout of flame will erupt from it, DEX 15 for 2d6 fire damage and the room begins to burn).
- Investigation check
  - DC 12 find a newly finished teak cleat near the entrance
    - If they don't get the hint, intelligence 10 to guess, based on the size and quality, that it's for one of the smaller private boats they've seen on the east side of the river at the private docks
  - DC 15 for a [Periapt of Health](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/periapt-of-health)
  - DC 18 to find spell notes etc
  - DC 20+ to notice that they bear many of the same markings that Wayra's did

A heavy storm comes through at night, waking the party.  Skill carousel to minimize damage to the structure, followed by some repair mini-games?


## K'anchay Order Investigations

**Mayua:** We suspect that Wayra and the cult have connections inside the city other than Sayre.  She was able to win a turf war, taking control of the underground, too quickly to have done it alone, even with the help of a necromancer.  Her takeover was brutal, efficient, and quiet; it wasn't clear it was happening until it was almost complete, and even then, it wasn't obvious that the takeover was backed by an outside power.  Llaska has been investigating them for the last few weeks, and while he's good, we could use more help.  Any information you can bring back to us, or cultists you can stop, would be quite valuable to the order.


**Llaska:** I'm hearing lots of things, but whoever these people are, they've been keeping a pretty tight lid on their identities and their goals.  They seem to have a presence in trading and shipping in the region, with the grain laundering and all that.  After what we saw with Sayre, I think there's a major push by the cult into Yalaqta.  To keep it this quiet, they must have some influential contacts in the city.  I'm thinking, probably a politician or two, or who knows, maybe all of 'em!  Hah!

If they wait a bit and then talk to him


**Llaska:** These guys are no joke, they're moving some sort of contraband through here, I'm just not sure how they're doing it yet, or what it is.  There are rumors of draughts that make you see spirits, jewels that cure disease, and something about animating runes.  Dunno what that's about, sounds bad for us though.  I keep hearing whispers about activity on the water, but I haven't been able to dredge anything concrete up at the docks yet...  Have you guys found anything?

### Combined Puzzle

Once they all have completed their individual puzzles (plans), they are dropped into some catacombs below the chapel through a trap door, which is shut behind them, disappearing.  After a moment, of darkness, some braziers on the wall spring to life.

#### Chamber 1

The chamber has a simple orange door on one wall, and the other three have a mural on them.  In the center of each, are a set of levers, labelled 1 through 9.  Pulling the right numbered levers on each wall will open the door.

Murals:
1. (791) The interior of a large mess hall full of people in simple clothes and robes, some with shaved heads.  Investigation check to notice that the mugs are not simply painted, but appear to be sculpted out of the stone of the wall.
2. (362) A shoreline of cracked earth, where a ship off shore burns.  A shadowy figure stands with his arm extended, holding a rapier pointed toward a tattooed man with short horns and a wicked grin on his face.  A small expanse littered with tiny objects separates them.  Investigation check determine that the objects are tetrahedral spikes.
3. (247) A dense treeline across a meadow, backed by snow-peaked mountains.  Squirrels, birds, and a small herd of deer can be seen on the border of the forest.  Perception 10 to realize that they're somehow slowly moving through the frame.  Investigation check to see that perched on a branch near the center is a large bird of prey, that seems to be watching Gluteus.


| Mistakes | Iva DC | Effect
|----------|--------|--------
|        1 |    N/A | They hear something shift through the walls of the chamber.
|        2 | Stealth| Iva enters through a small false wall.  If they notice her, they can't see, just catch some motion and then hear a sound inside the room
|        3 |     15 | Iva attacks once.  If they fail the perception, she turns invisible again.
|        4 |     10 | Iva attacks once.  If they fail the perception, she turns invisible again.
|        5 |      5 | Iva attacks once.  If they fail the perception, she turns invisible again.
|        6 |      0 | Iva attacks once.  Serena steps through another false wall and engages them.

**Serana:** (Through Iva) Sorry, wrong again!
**Serana:** (Through Iva) So close!
**Serana:** (Through Iva) Oh come on, really?  That one?
**Serana:** (Through Iva) *laughter*


If they clear the chamber:

**Serana:** Ah! You managed to figure it out, I was wondering how much longer I would have to wait.

Iva attacks with advantage
Initiative.

#### Chamber 2

You enter a large chamber with a low ceiling, about 40' wide and 70' long.  The center is dominated by an 8 by 8 grid of 5' by 5' tiles, that alternate black and white.  Written left to right on the floor in front of you, spaced 5' apart, are the letters a through h written in green.  On the left wall, also spaced 5' apart, are the numbers 1 through 8, written in blue.  If Gluteus tries to fly across, DC 15 DEX to make it (low ceiling) or to fall on a random square, triggering an effect.  If he makes it across, the door is locked.

Chessboard addressing with the numbers to indicate the safe squares.  Blue for Y axis, Green for X axis.

Bad square effects (all DCs are for saving throws)

| Row | Effect
|-----|--------
|   1 | A barrier appears as you take a step that you collide with, like walking into a screen door you didn't notice, except it disappears when you take a step back
|   2 | DC 13 DEX or slip, fall prone and slide to next square
|   3 | DC 13 WIS or charmed for 1 round and compelled to leap back and look into the previous room for a second.  You could have *sworn* you left something in there...
|   4 | DC 13 CON or 1d4 poison damage, poisoned for one move (disadvantage on next skill check)
|   5 | DC 13 INT or you're *convinced* the floor is starting to split open beneath your feet (as with <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/{{ 'Phantasmal Force' | downcase | split: ' ' | join: '-' }}">Phantasmal Force</a>)
|   6 | DC 13 STR as an unknown force impacts your side, trying to shove you 5' to the left.  If in a6, a fail is 1d6 bludgeoning damage instead.
|   7 | DC 13 CHA or 1 round <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/{{ 'Banish' | downcase | split: ' ' | join: '-' }}">Banish</a> to the Astral Plane.
|   8 | You're blinded while standing on this square, DC 13 INT to work out your orientation, on a fail roll 1d4 to determine the direction you move on your next round. 1/2/3/4 -> N/S/E/W

#### Chamber 3


You enter the near the ceiling of a tall semi-circular room, with a narrow staircase carved into the stone to your right.  The floor is about 20' down, and slopes gently toward the center of the far wall.  There, you see a small semicircular depression in the floor, with narrow, shallow, channels radiating outward toward the walls.  Above it, on the wall, is a mural of a road and a river, heading up toward a city on a bluff overlooking a large bay.  Placed straddling each of the channels is a workbench, each with an array of different tools; blacksmith's tools, leatherworker's tools, even tinker's tools, and a jeweler's kit.  Standing near the center of the room, you see Mayua, and an older man with a shock of thin white hair.

Mayua and the quartermaster, Yori Olaya, greet the party, congratulating them on solving their puzzles and making their way through the rooms.  They explain the process of fabrication and have a variety of base equipment available that can be used to craft their items.

Voice the quartermaster with "The Bernie."
