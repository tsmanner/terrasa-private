### Lightcraft Fist Tattoos:

***Magical Strikes.*** While the tattoo is on your skin, your unarmed strikes are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming immunity and resistance to nonmagical attacks, and your melee attacks deal an extra 1d4 radiant damage on hit to undead creatures.

***Charging.*** Whenever you strike an enemy with your Martial Arts bonus action or Flurry of Blows, you gain one charge, to a maximum of 2/4/6/10.  You lose all charges at the end of a long rest.

***Radiant Flurry.*** When you take the Attack action and make an attack with a monk weapon or unarmed strike, you can use a Bonus Action and expend any number or charges to cause radiant images of your weapon or fist to appear mimicking your strike against additional creatures within 15 feet of your target, one per charge expended.  Each creature targeted in this way must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your Ki save DC (8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier) or take radiant damage equal to half the attacks damage, rounded down (minimum 1).  This damage cannot be applied to the same creature multiple times in one attack.

***Deflect Blade.*** You can use your reaction and expend two charges to deflect or grab the weapon or wrist when you are hit by a melee weapon attack or unarmed strike. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.  The light radiating from the tattoo coalesces in the palm of your hand as a barrier

## Homebrew

**Manco's Wand of Animate Dead** - Once per day can be used by the wielder to cast Animate Dead as if it were being cast by Manco.  The undead created in this way are created using the statistics of Manco, and they are under his control.  If the wielder of the wand is a known ally of Manco, the undead are friendly to them and follow their orders, otherwise they are hostile.

**Bead of Alarm** like bead of force, but when broken notifies another party or rings a distant bell.
