### Lightcraft Scimitar and Karambit


While wielding both weapons and they are activated, when you hit with the bonus action attack as part of two-weapon fighting, you can make a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the target's Wisdom (Insight) check.  If you succeed on the check, you may roll your sneak dice and add half the total, rounded down, to the damage of your strike.  Additionally, the karambit blade can be thrown by swiping toward a target without releasing the handle.  The blade springs back into existence on the hilt immediately after the thrown blade comes to rest.

|    Dawn  (_uncommon_) |                          +0 | Radiant Blade<br/>Deceptive Precision |           1d4 | A simple, leather wrapped grip with a slight forward curve at the bottom, ending with a two inch long barb-like pommel, and a semicircular rainguard with no crossguard, engraved with the outline of a road and river leading to a sunrise.
| Morning      (_rare_) |                          +1 |                                       |           1d8 |
|     Day (_very rare_) |                          +2 |                                       |           2d8 |
|  Zenith (_legendary_) |                          +3 |                                       |           3d8 |

***Radiant Blade.*** While the blade is active, attacks with this weapon deal extra radiant damage on hit to undead creatures.

***Deceptive Precision.*** When you hit a second target with the bonus action attack as part of Two-Weapon Fighting, you can make a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the target's Wisdom (Insight) check.  If you succeed on the check, you may roll your sneak dice and add half the total, rounded down, to the damage.

### Lightcraft Longbow


|    Name      (rarity) | Attack and<br/>Damage Bonus |                               Traits | Radiant Shot | Description
|-----------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------|-------------
|    Dawn  (_uncommon_) |                          +0 |     Radiant Shot<br/>Hunter's Fervor |          1d4 | This appears to be, and functions as, a quarterstaff, with metal caps on both ends that have simple engravings of a road and river heading to a sunrise.
| Morning      (_rare_) |                          +1 |                     Favored Radiance |          1d8 |
|     Day (_very rare_) |                          +2 |                                      |          2d8 |
|  Zenith (_legendary_) |                          +3 |                                      |          3d8 |

***Radiant Shot.*** While holding it, you can use a bonus action to speak the command word and make a punching motion while grasping to middle of the staff to cause a radiant bowstring to appear connecting the tips together, transforming it into a longbow.  If you can make multiple attacks as part of the Attack action, this bonus action can be taken between these attacks.  When you grab the bowstring to begin drawing it, an arrow made of radiant energy appears nocked between your fingers.  While the bowstring is active, ranged attacks with this weapon deal extra radiant damage on hit to undead creatures.

***Hunter's Fervor.*** When a favored enemy under the affect of your Hunter's Mark drops to 0 hit points, the additional damage done by Hunter's Mark increases by 1 for the remainder of the spell.

***Favored Radiance.*** When you take the Attack action, in addition to your normal attacks, you may make one ranged weapon attack against each of your favored enemies that you can see, within your short range.  Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

***Radiant Strike.*** While the tattoo is on your skin, your melee attacks deal extra radiant damage on hit to undead creatures.

***Charging.*** Whenever you strike an enemy with your Martial Arts bonus action or Flurry of Blows, you gain one charge, to a maximum of 2/4/6/10.  You lose all charges at the end of a long rest.

***Radiant Flurry.*** When you take the Attack action and make an attack with a monk weapon or unarmed strike, you can use a Bonus Action and expend any number or charges to cause radiant images of your weapon or fist to appear mimicking your strike against additional creatures within 15 feet of your target, one per charge expended.  Each creature targeted in this way must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your Ki save DC (8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier) or take radiant damage equal to half the attacks damage, rounded down (minimum 1).  This damage cannot be applied to the same creature multiple times in one attack.

***Deflect Blade.*** You can use your reaction and expend two charges to deflect or grab the weapon or wrist when you are hit by a melee weapon attack or unarmed strike. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.  The light radiating from the tattoo coalesces in the palm of your hand as a barrier


## Homebrew

**Manco's Wand of Animate Dead** - Once per day can be used by the wielder to cast Animate Dead as if it were being cast by Manco.  The undead created in this way are created using the statistics of Manco, and they are under his control.  If the wielder of the wand is a known ally of Manco, the undead are friendly to them and follow their orders, otherwise they are hostile.

**Bead of Alarm** like bead of force, but when broken notifies another party or rings a distant bell.
