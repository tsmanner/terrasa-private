### Session 1

---

Caravan arrives: Maran calls all the the caravan guards over, including the party.

> Maran: Now that we've reached Yalaqta, we're going to head to the market to trade. We'll be here, eh..., three to four days, depending on how things go. In the meantime, if you'd like to keep busy, there are a couple places around that usually have jobs posted.

> Maran (pointing left): If you head over to town hall they usually have some postings about issues affecting the locals, weird happenings by the farms or rats in the sewer, that sort of thing.

> Maran (pointing behind): There's a militia barracks back the way we came, near where we entered town.  They're always looking for able bodies to help with bandits and criminals.

> Maran (pointing ahead): Oh, and I almost forgot, the market! Sometimes wares go missing and the merchants there need someone to look into it, or, if it suits your fancy, there are usually caravans packing up to head to another town, and every caravan needs an escort.

> Maran (handing each of you 1gp): Here's your pay for this leg of the journey, and I hope to be hearing from you in a couple days. Good luck out there!

Maran walks back over to the wagons shouting "Ok everybody, let's head down to the market and get set up!"


> Shifty Guy (pointing right): We're going to head down this way, and get a _real_ drink. I got a, uh, cousin down there that's always got some odd jobs that need doin'.

Shifty Guy and a Hunter walk off to the right toward the docks


Two others in mail with swords and shields head back toward the militia barracks.


Two other members of the roughly ten person caravan escort. The first is a tall slender man wearing a full length robe and and carrying a pouch around his neck, a small pack, and an ornate jeweled dagger on his hip. The second is wearing a chain mail vest, plate greaves, and gauntlets, with a spear over one shoulder and a quiver with several javelins over the other and a large pack on his back.

Caltrop tries attempts to pick pocket the robed man, but ends up roughly bumping into him. Caltrop manages to play it off as though he stumbled, raising the suspicious of both men, but not inciting anything worse.

Once {the_party} reaches town hall, they look over the job board, deciding between a rat infestation and mysterious disappearances in the woods. They choose to investigate the disappearances, hearing that a couple of farmers went missing and the three person militia squad that went out in search of them only had one member return. The remaining member is stable, recovering from wounds, at the militia barracks.


{the_party} heads over to the militia barracks and learn that the surviving militiaman is named Frankie. After convincing someone that Caltrop is Frankie's friend, they head up to Frankie's room and ask him some questions. Frankie was clearly scratched and bitten by something and he still seems shocked or horrified by whatever he saw. He tells {the_party} that he found "it" in the forest west of town, just to the north of the giant birch on the right.


### Session 2

---

{the_party} heads to the market, leaving Kilvin behind to keep an eye out

Approach a teen playing in the market and ask about Frankie.
"Who's that?"
Party starts to babble about stuff
"Hold on one sec kid"
"Uh, ok"
Kid returns to kicking around a ball and running around with his friends
Ask about the birch tree, kid saw some on the way to town.
Ask about local kids, he doesn't really know much, except they come down sometimes with their parents

Go to more permanent looking booth occupied by a local farmer

Maximus flies back to get Kilvin and they meet up with the others by the western road out of town

Fight the zombies

Return to town with their heads as proof.  While 

Ryan robs some people of their iron silverware

Spend the night with the caravan

Head to town hall in the morning to get payment for the zombies.  Suspicious of the clerk for hiding the ledger sheet, they ask about it.  Was 3gp originally, increased to 5 + 1 per monster after the militia patrol failed.

### 13 Sept 2020

---

Check job board outside, take grain job.  Head in to town hall, Achiq, the town clerk, lets them know it's the western silo, nearer the slums and docks that is missing grain.

Head to silo, talk to Thani, a militia member tasked with guarding the grain, who they convince they are here to help.  He shows them how to get in and tells them what he knows.  Kilvin and Caltrop drop into the silo, finding the rat hole and are swarmed by rats.  Gromag and Gluteus investigate the exterior, finding evidence that a ladder was likely placed to climb onto the exterior stairs partway up and gain entry to the grain store.  While walking to tell Thani, Kilvin, and Caltrop, they hear a shout from inside the silo and run up to find Kilvin shaking a rat off his hand.

Successfully fight off 4 swarms of rats, which are largely ineffective against Kilvin's armor.  Gluteus is on FIRE with his bow, skewering multiple rats per shot. They clear out the silo of rats, and end the session telling Thani what they found and taking a short rest so that Kilvin and Gromag can recover their strength and energy.

### 8 nov 2020

---

Tracked the ladder to some rubble near a decrepit shanty, which is abandoned.  They leave Kilvin behind to keep an eye out, in case anyone comes for the ladder.

They go to The Rusty Nail, a tavern by the dockside.  Ask drunk dockworker about the tavernkeepr, Olaya.  Approach the bar and talk to Olaya a bit, interrupted by Llaska, who speaks to Caltrop in the Thieves' Cant.  He and Michik had been small time thieves before.

Dockside: East side, more spaced out, more active, mostly loading/unloading, and and out for a day.  3 Guard posts along the waterfront, small 1 room spaces with an open window and a small desk, where guards store a ledger and maintain a static presence.  Dockmaster's office on the eastern end, nearest the river, a small two room office with a window on the front to interact with people through, and a side door.

Party talked to a guard at the nearest post (middle, spoke to Waqar) who directed them to the dockmaster for more on the goings on at the docks.  They tried to ask Chalco, the dockmaster(mistress?), with heavy innuendo, about smuggling or moving goods through the docks "discreetly."  She replied that there are rare random searches, but generally, if the goods you have on your manifest match the goods you move around, that's all the scrutiny you'll get.  A nearby ship was loading up mostly food stuffs, the Windwharf, for a trip north.  Among other things they were carrying grain.  Gluteus went to fetch Kilvin, while Caltrop and Gromag investigate the Windwharf.

While Gromag creates a distraction by jumping atop a cart being unloaded and playing his bagpipes, Caltrop slips below.  Snooping through the captain's quarters and the cargo hold, he suspects that the stolen grain is being laundered as part of larger sales to merchants like this.  He thinks better of setting the ship on fire, instead sneaking back up on deck.

Gromag is shouted at and capitulates, hopping off the cart, attempting to do a cartwheel down the gangplank to set back up on the dock to play.  He loses his balance on the way and slips, falling into the water.  Shortly after swimming ashore and walking back out the dock, Caltrop returns and they meet Kilvin and Gluteus at the base of the dock, near the dockmaster's office.  After checking in with her, they manage to track down a susicious cart they had seen loading the boat with some stolen grain, and follow it.  The man pulling it marks them, beginning to flee, and is almost immediately caught by Gluteus, using his rope to trip the man.  Caltrop follows with a painful, but not fatal wound, at which point he surrenders and tells the party about the theives' den, the side entrance, and that evening, around dinner, is probably the best time to enter.



Alarm beads, kinda like bead of force, but when broken notifies another party or rings a distant bell.
