Hill Dwarf
Forge Cleric

From Dhagdarom, a small dwarven village in the foothills of the D'Sane Mountains in the north, mentored by Dalozuk Forgemaker.  Dalozuk disappeared one day, without leaving any message behind.  Rumor was that he was traveling south west, but no one was certain why or to where.  Kilvin left with the next Go'Val caravan to pass by with plans to head that direction.
