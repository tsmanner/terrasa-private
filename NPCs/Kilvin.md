Hill Dwarf
Forge Cleric

From Dhagdarom, a small dwarven village in the foothills of the D'Sane Mountains in the north, mentored by Dalozuk Forgemaker.  Dalozuk disappeared one day, without leaving any message behind.  Most of the rumors were that he had been taken, killed, or had abandoned the village for some reason.  Kilvin left in search of Dazoluk with the next Go'Val caravan to pass through, guessing that he had gone west toward the port city of Chimaylla.
