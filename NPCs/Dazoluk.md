A high level Forge Cleric, from Deleduhr originally, who lived in Dhagdarom for many years.  A veteran member of the K'anchay Order, he was called upon to investigate and help quell the recent spike in Cult of Myrkul activity, especially near the western coast.  He left Dhagdarom, traveling to Chimaylla and taking a ship to Yalaqta, where he is pursuing an agent of the Cult.
