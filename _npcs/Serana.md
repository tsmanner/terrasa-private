A highly effective mid-level agent of the [K'anchay Order][1], Serana, and her familiar [Iva][2], have risen quickly through the ranks.  Serana is a warlock bound to the service of one of a celestial, who has granted her some magical abilities.

She and Iva first worked together clearing a pocket of undead from a forest in the south east.  They bonded, and continued to fight evil encroaching on those forests for many years.  Recently, they were approached by a celestial, which offered to lend them some of it's power, if they would continue to fight evil in the name of the K'anchay Order.  They agreed, and were shown to a nearby Garden, where they honed their skills among the druids and rangers.
