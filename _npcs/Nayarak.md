Jewelry Mogul Nayarak runs a very successful set of jewelry stores, and is the head of the Yalaqta market merchant's association.

Born to a wealthy family in decline, his parents died when he was in his late 20s, revealing to him and his siblings that they were in debt to some unsavory people, with no way to pay it back.  Nayarak indiscriminately sold off his family's assets to pay down those debts, without consulting his siblings.  When they started organizing to stop him, they went missing, supposedly having moved to another city.  Nayarak made some contacts within the criminal element of Yalaqta, and used it to jump start a jewelry shop.  His connections, intelligence, and cutthroat business dealing quickly brought success.

Now, in his middle age, he is searching for a way to prolong his life so he can continue to gain in wealth and power.  His ambition and mastery of jewelcraft led him to study the arcane for ways to further improve his work, and he realized that he could combine the two to achieve his greater goal.  He sells enchanted jewelry to some exclusive clientele, and to members of the Cult, through Izhi.  His most powerful creations have been completed in concert with Izhi's powerful bursts of magic.

Shops:
  - Pari's Apt Periapts
  - Nayarak

Several of his shops and other pieces of real estate have laboratories beneath them where he conducts experiments and works on new items.

He is in league with Izhi, though he does not subscribe to the Cult's beliefs or goals.  A middle aged man, he seeks power and youth, being drawn to the power of necromancy anyway, a relationship with the cult was symbiotic.
  - He has learned a couple of necromantic secrets and is able to imbue them into jewelry, saving the most powerful for himself.
  - He came across a supply of grain from "an old family friend" but had no means to sell it himself, so he used his status as chair of the market merchant's association to find some people willing to buy it to resell in the market.
  - He owns property all over the city, several pieces under a pseudonym.  One of these is the building used in the "Helmed Horror" event.
  - He lives on the waterfront in the Hanaska District, and has a small dock there.
