# Caltrop Bloodless (Ryan)

Former crew for captain Izhi, a regionally infamous pirate.  Cheated Caltrop out of his share of "the profits" and he wants his due.


Plot ideas:
Izhi came across a sentient item of some kind that is evil and has made him more bloodthirsty as it seeks to sate it's thirst, and/or release it's master from imprisonment/the lower planes/whatever and unleash it on the world.

Over time he became more and more violent, slaughtering entire crews for the smallest of slights.  More often than not, leaving no survivors after commandeering a ship.

Why did Caltrop abandon the crew?
  - He grew a conscience.
  - He refused to take part in an unjustified slaughter.


After a bounty/treasure, did some terrible things.  Caltrop showed a little empathy, the captain saw that.  Things got progressively worse, and on that last voyage he had a moment of realization, thinking "how did we get here?"  His crew didn't appreciate that and treated him as a prisoner after that, denying him any payment, eventually leaving him behind at a port.
