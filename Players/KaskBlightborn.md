The name Blightborn comes from the area where my family has lived for generations. I come from a long line of fisherman, and my family was known for our ability to catch and preserve fish. Salt being the main component in the preservation of our wares has also scared and cracked the earth where we work. Trees, ivy, nor crops can be cultivated on our land, and the term Blight only seemed fitting to my ancestors.

While crops could not be cultivated, my family has always been able to trade and barter for anything that we needed. Working the markets, creating a demand, and knowing what people want has always been a small part of our family's nature.

As the eldest son, this obligation fell to me. I was trained by my father's older brother to blend in with locals despite my Tiefling stature and appearance. From the art of disguise, to forgery, and even a little bit, well... maybe a lot, of gambling. Like all Blightborns, I was trained that ownership of an item is a bit ambiguous.

For the most part, our family does what it needs to in order to survive, and these skills are passed from generation to generation as a means to keep demand for salted fish high. However, after I made a deal that would lead to my father's death. I left the family and buried myself in the shadows.

Pirates have always had a strong tie with my family, due to our ability to supply as many fish as any pirate vessel could ever need. In fact it is such a common practice for us to sell to pirates, it has almost become a right of passage for the eldest son to create a contract with one of the more tame pirates. For me that was Captain Ozark. He was an older captain who had his one territory, a raucous crew, and a reputation that was extrapolated beyond reality.

The deal was simple, we would trade barrels of salted fish for the rights to fly Ozark's colors. Our family never had problems catching fish, but now with all the intimidation of Ozark on our side we could fish anywhere.

I do not know what happened that day, as I was working my leverage at the market, but when I came home I saw that Ozark had killed my father and burned his ship. My brother Caltrop was captured, and our family blamed me for the whole thing.

I later found out that my brother had adopted the pirate life, and sailed under a new captain named Izhi. Rumors say that Izhi planned the mutiny that lead to my father's death, but only Caltrop knows the truth.

I now work as a member of small network of shadows. We are not spy's or criminals, but that does not mean we do not steal or gather information. We are currently investigating a cult like group that is in the area, but I have just received word that my brother is on the main land.

I do not know why but it seems like he is also investigating the same cult as I, or maybe he is part of it? I have been following loosely for a day or so, but he seems to be working with one of my informants Llaska. While Llaska may not be the brightest, I know that he has the backing of one of the religious factions around here.

He tried to get me to join them at one point, but the whole Lathander bullshit is just a waste of time.
