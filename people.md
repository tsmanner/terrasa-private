## Ciann (incan)
Country: Ciann ("key" "ahn")
People: Cianni ("key" "ah" "nee")

Ciann is a relatively small country along the western coast of Sherago.  It is temperate and mostly covered by deciduous forests which have grown over the tops of large ancient dunes, some of which still lie exposed.  The coast is known for sandy beaches backed by enormous sand dunes, which vary widely in size and pitch depending on how close the dunes are to the water.

To the north, it is bordered by Tunii.
To the east is a large area dominated by wetlands, making construction very difficult and serving as an effective barrier against invasion.
To the south
