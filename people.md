## Ciann (incan)
Country: Ciann ("key" "ahn")
People: Cianni ("key" "ah" "nee")

Ciann is a relatively small country along the western coast of Sherago.  It is temperate and mostly covered by deciduous forests which have grown over the tops of large ancient dunes, some of which still lie exposed.  The coast is known for sandy beaches backed by enormous sand dunes, which vary widely in size and pitch depending on how close the dunes are to the water.

The Cianni government has banned the use of teleportation circles within the empire without a license.  As a result, circles are very rare, almost exclusively used for transportation between government offices in the regional capitals and Ciannllaqta.

To the north, it is bordered by Tunii.
To the east is a large area dominated by wetlands, making construction very difficult and serving as an effective barrier against invasion.
To the south

## World History

Around 100 years ago, an ancient and powerful magical artifact (the "something with Oqe in it, related to Myrkul and/or Necromancy") was discovered near the center of Sherago, with several nations claiming ownership of the it.  After a series of skirmishes, a treaty was signed that created a demilitarized zone around the artifact, and establishing an approval process for researchers to gain access.

Military assets made their way in, masquerading as researchers, which led to a violent clash at the artifact site, prompting open military action.  No one knows exactly what happened, but the artifact was activated, sapping all life in the immediate area and creating a large region of accelerated decay around it.  This region is known today as the Oqemarsh.

The nations all blamed each other for the catastrophe, involving them all in a war that dragged on for almost two decades.  Hundreds of thousands lost their lives, including many civilians, in no small part due to the use of teleportation circles.  Most regions relied heavily on them to transport goods across the country or continent for trade, but militaries and insurgent groups gained access to them and started striking deep into others' territory in attempts to distract and fatigue their enemies.

When the war finally ended, the treaty included a ban on the use of teleportation circles, unless approved by the governments of a majority of the nations.  To this day, some criminal organizations operate them, but they change the sigil sequennces, move the circles, and use them sparingly, for fear of uniting the governments of Sherago against them.
