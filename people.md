## Go' -

Nomadic and not affiliated with any one country, these disparate tribes of people can be found all across the continent Sherago.

### Go'Val
Most Go'Val live as members of traveling caravans, often as traders. Some Go'Val are mercenaries, finding work in towns while their caravans are stopped. A few are bounty hunters, directing their caravans toward areas of interest for the bounties they seek.

## Ciann (incan)
Country: Ciann ("key" "ahn")
People: Cianni ("key" "ah" "nee")

Ciann is a relatively small country along the western coast of Sherago.  It is temperate and mostly covered by deciduous forests which have grown over the tops of large ancient dunes, some of which still lie exposed.  The coast is known for sandy beaches backed by enormous sand dunes, which vary widely in size and pitch depending on how close the dunes are to the water.

The Cianni government has banned the use of teleportation circles within the empire without a license.  As a result, circles are very rare, almost exclusively used for transportation between government offices in the regional capitals and Ciannllaqta.

To the north, it is bordered by Tunii.
To the east is a large area dominated by wetlands, making construction very difficult and serving as an effective barrier against invasion.
To the south

## World History
Around 100 years ago, a border dispute involving a powerful magical artifact from before The Calamity escalated into an all out war.  Every nation on Sherago was involved by the end, in a war that dragged on for almost two decades.  Hundreds of thousands lost their lives, including many civilians, in no small part due to the use of teleportation circles.  Most regions relied heavily on them to transport goods across the country or continent for trade, but militaries and insurgent groups gained access to them and started striking deep into others' territory in attempts to distract and fatigue their enemies.  When the war finally ended, the treaty included a ban on the use of teleportation circles, unless approved by the governments of a majority of the nations.  To this day, some criminal organizations operate them, but they change the sigil sequennces, move the circles, and use them sparingly, for fear of uniting the governments of Sherago against them.
